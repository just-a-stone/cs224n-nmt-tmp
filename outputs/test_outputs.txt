You know that what I do is I write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, I read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like a farmer, or with leather clothes, and never anyone has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany usually is something that came to you somewhere.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated circle that I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle school, in the middle school, where I was the rare class of class.
When I was shocked to bleed every week in the lunch room, until one teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by allowing me to go into the food room.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and it ended in San Francisco, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we have never got to know us.
You could get it to Ohio, and please bring that man that you have found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to stick with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found one of the <unk> and we take care and take care of her family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to be <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about was made up in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs true and beauty, and I'm very happy today that I talked about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I went around with my <unk> almost 60 meters -- and I couldn't even think that it was about a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they come from the glaciers or they break the ice.
Every iceberg has his own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with its environment, and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to offer, and they hold up to the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you look at a <unk> which are isolated by each other as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing your ancestral atmosphere.
As an iceberg melt out, it releases rich fresh water that feeds in many ways of life.
I come home to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are in that way and will not exist in that way again.
It's not death when they're <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> which photograph is very <unk> he's got a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is from an iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to get to actually witness an iceberg <unk>
Here they are.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg in size.
<unk> of the water is about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop to think of conception itself, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined by the X chromosome.
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll get back to them later.
On my activity that will land two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- you know, human bodies and <unk> how have the body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with sex sex, individuals whose physical universe doesn't fit into male <unk> and conventional female <unk>
At the end, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> so many ways.
I'm going to give you a few examples in ways of having sex that are not <unk> in the middle of male or female.
For example, there is the case of the individual with the <unk> <unk> which is whose gene <unk> the chromosome is telling the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testes are making testosterone.
But because this individual is none of receptors from testosterone, it doesn't react to the same.
It's the <unk> of <unk>
So, there are high testosterone levels -- but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops following a female.
When you go to the baby as a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast survival, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And then you realize that, instead of having ovaries and <unk> actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like this.
Women, like men, we have in the body called areolar glands.
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce the <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women as I -- I consider a woman who doesn't know its <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
<unk> <unk> and respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with <unk> who have the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a bit complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and she had sex with her, he was wearing a life like a boy and I had just figured out she had ovaries and womb.
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th tree and the uterus the <unk> glands were so active that they were essentially creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at 19 years when he started to have failed problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors found that in fact, it was woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th century -- they develop what is known as <unk> that is -- they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- it will be <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> or <unk> <unk> surgeries is not to be able to make a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason you join various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have a female identity -- <unk> being black, you mean having African anatomy in time.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present to us a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very distinctive ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is having children who are born like two people inside one body.
The highest case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> their sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called to ask, "What do you test to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you the reporters that there's no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women and <unk> and women and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more it comes to science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought these categories were kind of a little bit more stable categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology solved.
So as we see, we go into a hot terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact that we have <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, are the struggles at beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know inside the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to come up with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot would put on a pen in front of his nose and he passed it still <unk>
If he stopped moving it down.
But we can, for example, extracting our vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of actually force death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a liberal, to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I put nervous.
I think these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were <unk>
It was <unk> from a concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent <unk> of <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were as brave and audacious and so <unk> in what they did, I find myself every so much watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain to you why.
What they did was that they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and they <unk> it with another one that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the Internet of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea of the idea that they could get the political power of the grandfather passed the grandfather and then the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new concept, <unk> and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk>
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it stays very clear if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to pass it out of a <unk> <unk> idea.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of Independence, speak about nature and god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years later?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people of <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man.
And again, people of color that were going to take a lot of <unk> the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves, why we keep them certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some tragic <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> to anatomy.
I don't want to say that at five years to allow them to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> which is a sense of me, and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two items in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time -- June 1 1980.
Henry, on the other hand, was born in term, was born December March March March one.
For the only fact that being born three months before Mary were attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the vote, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because he was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Here's an virtue of being considered -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered -- it's now <unk> from the compulsory <unk> that Mary has no worry about.
Mary. on his hand, does not have the same rights to marriage for instance.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So they still do similar categories just like in various aspects of them are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved both in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science has been <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some time has decided that to marry a man with no <unk> and to marry a woman you've got to have chromosome.
Now, in practice, they don't make testing people <unk>
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love <unk> it offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people judge not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do we judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure we should be involved in this to <unk> rights to people, because I will admit that I know some of some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships that I know.
So how do you put the theme of content from <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured in the future being measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is continuing to lead this current thinking relative to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to be killed, unless he's willing to submit to a change of sex, in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had done <unk> twins, and then they <unk> their fame.
But when I was asking the phone for the operation, I was a very <unk> operation, he responded to me in that other country, these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, he's considered the political asylum instead of the separation <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people who are who are <unk> to change the same of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given more involvement in the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about groups.
For years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in the <unk>
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about studies studies is that women, on average, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism -- <unk> considered me as <unk> made me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what is about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I have heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, more than there is something women in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the female brains and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and help to help the most vulnerable.
So while the <unk> were very much aware to find the way to protect people in the state, it's possible to have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we get to democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect union union we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when each of the family will think where they want to go live and work, have the possibility to choose between the least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now we are far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world <unk> maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just ran out of buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments are already owners, and the other half still will not stand to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to be able to <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, build a whole new apartment building a whole new apartment building, always and when the rules of that <unk> place is the construction instead of putting it off.
So I suggested that governments are going to add new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, I went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next election elections -- <unk> <unk> imposed imposed by a platform in which promised <unk> and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked her to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its more essential.
The first point was the importance of rules like those rules that say you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It was a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like <unk> rules and usually the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They called me off.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities, much more valuable than the cost of <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City. which, in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion -- and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in just very simple terms, which is a place where you start with terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are attached to it, and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to go and talk again about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that was going to be at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that you could go might be in <unk> rather than hundreds of kilometers away to the North.
And we also have new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government would need help in <unk> countries could benefit from the countries that are associated with them to help them establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that they could all trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily covering a thousand square miles.
And little later, the 19 de January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow you to create these special standards of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the vote in favor of this constitutional industry was from <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the puzzles in society, the <unk>
In the <unk> we have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was approved again in another voting -- <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting in the age of 21, the <unk> of about 30 <unk> was the two places in the world who are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that is building in Korea <unk> it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years to get the <unk>
The other country is interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this kind of practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> to operate under a external legal system.
A country has already committed to allowing her Supreme Court to be the court for this new justice system.
There are urban <unk> of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are many companies who wanted to get in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to go get a job work, sometimes they are unwed mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do we build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it think about <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you TED TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to do a public confession and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love finding cover, and more recently to photograph and publish in my <unk> and colorful and different <unk> blog for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet <unk> people -- usually my money is going to be good <unk> My way is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be in my size?
I would like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all this <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought you seven pairs of <unk> and nothing else.
So inside of them for exactly a week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I thought I would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after getting to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me like the woman who walks for TED in <unk>  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, or not, I've learned in this adventure not to use new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is <unk> <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see you <unk> for less than 50 dollars.
All of the whole, including the <unk> including the <unk> and the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be out of <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red pants <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just love you, too.
<unk> <unk> of the child who is wearing it.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like play the <unk> or I remind you to her <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is key.
If you think you see you good with something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inside and outside, you can't see you cannot <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it again and again when people were approaching me this week just because of what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally emotionally at all of these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy and <unk> and bright suit if there's a little love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you look at a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So, where does your brain look at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most other quantum physicists have a lot of logical quantum physicists that we need to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put on playing with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As intuition as intuition that you may have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be just in a place at the time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a boy playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and he didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar in the parking lot showed him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things cannot allow them to go and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with black bars and play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover they do all kinds of things really weird -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was a physics for a few years ago; you needed the quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That's not very good at my intuition, and maybe it's not too often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it also wasn't good at my logic.
Because if it's all made up of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't be following the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it didn't.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom here a little bit. You find it right in the center.
And then here we do a very good approach to the little <unk> of metal.
So what we see is a little bit of metal, a little bit of metal -- and that runs supported on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip again, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this little <unk> <unk> <unk> that is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for that it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up, I stop doing those things, because I don't want them to be <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave the same way.
The fellow people on the journey of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind behind the room and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to be <unk> according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive out to all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
They went down the lights -- then they get a <unk> and pulled all the air, and then they put it up to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when I was only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We found that he moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was <unk> and the way it <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and you don't go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing is <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think of atoms.
In one case, all trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, a scale difference between one atom and that little piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one only atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, Why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my logic that talks about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How to act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it up, and we turned the lights on, and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just embedded in a small space.
You hear a lot about a lot about quantum mechanics to say that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, is more profound.
It is that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And I was about 18 months ago I was doing another work at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that's here and allowed me to do this.
It took me 18 months to me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they took it to 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is simply explaining simply on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't get it, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go into museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to reality the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show you a demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery <unk> the MoMA, <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, the <unk> art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
And we click on, and we click on the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and on one click we jumped in.
They're inside of the hall that you want to go at the end of the fields.
And continue to go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the sign sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the data from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click right right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the technology <unk>
So this image -- for example, <unk> I think, about 10 billion pixel away.
And there's a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get about 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10 billion pixel at you.
You can zoom in around in a very simple way.
You see funny things that are happening.
I love this kid, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to hear it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually discovered this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> on a Tuesday <unk> stick.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper in depth and you'll see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little perspective, I'm going to remove the image, so you'll actually see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Van <unk> actually created this <unk> work.
It enhances it and really <unk> it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the <unk> night -- I think I'd never seen this before.
Let me show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that's the same way.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walk in, I've created this function that I call <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
This is <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can make things, send your friends to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even of the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice for his work of art and that is represented properly online.
And the great question that I'm doing today is, "You did this to replicate the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
So I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a flying pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian origin -- all the children in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that something really interesting is that something really interesting in Formula 1 in the last two decades.
It has already some time ago, if you wanted to win a death career, one, take a budget and put it to a good driver and a good car, a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what in engineering, the control control system will happen.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What is interesting today is that the control systems are actually starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronic electronics.
They're becoming <unk> computers.
And as <unk> are starting to respond to different and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet but represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition for <unk> <unk> for the end of MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
In a way, it is like almost all of the existing atoms were coming back and <unk>
And that's totally changing the interaction that we have with the outer environment.
In a sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and he came back to the Moses -- he was actually a little bit of a <unk> <unk> and he said <unk> <unk> In fact, <unk> <unk> What don't you <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you only about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
So let's start with the detection of the detection of the detection of the detection of the detection of the detection of the detection of the detection of the detection of the detection of the detection of the detection of the detection of the detection of this.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a very lucky summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup the World.
Maybe some of you remember it, they were playing <unk> and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity happens in the Web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before the game.
The timeline.
At the late early afternoon, there are people over here and doing phone calls, <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people are doing a fast call and <unk>
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, yeah!
That night they were all at <unk> at the center.
There you see the great summit.
The next day, everyone went into the center of the winning team and the prime minister of then.
And then everybody would die.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people will <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today we know everything about the stream of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how it comes in?
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift, through the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle recently more than a year ago, to tag what they were making different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
This is <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there is a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> I don't still have anywhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we <unk> you still still go out there.
That if we show it to people, then we will be able to promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and a lot of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city that came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology can technology, new technology to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and you throw off valves of <unk> <unk> and you get open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with water pixels and water.
If you drop the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, <unk>
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the Mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And they took a commission to design the building on the entrance to the <unk>
We call it the <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no windows, no windows, but when you get up to the space that you can come back.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, as in this case.
Those days would always be someone, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they have it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture away.
Here it is working.
You see the people who are going on with what happens in the inside.
And here I am trying to do not <unk> by testing the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact with had changed a little bit.
It wasn't a building that was open to let you go, but a building that was still making cuts and holes in water, and you had to jump to not get wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use people to give our designs.
But then it's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels and the water pixels and the projections of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and you can get a little pixel in the air -- that it changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, where we saw before, that moves with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, right?
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or so, but in three dimensions, where it changes is the light, not the position of the pixel at the house.
You can play it with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, and different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a 3D pixels in 3D where you can get closer, and you can see from very diverse <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light goes on, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the greatest <unk> dancers today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's so much, 3D digitization in real time as it capture.
It can push all the movement.
You can go around the road.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our environment -- as a <unk> nursery like <unk> farming as <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could do all of a little bit of a little bit of a <unk>
And I think what's remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we get from the physical world to the digital world.
We've looked at everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world of the digital world, of the <unk> in the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change, or CO2 emissions, how will move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together together in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the other.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in the pixel
You can move around with different experiences.
You can see from the bottom of the bottom, to share the moments of the Olympics of 2012, and even more, and can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of heaven as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better at what they are.
Suppose you would tell you that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could improve <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better way, to be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is it that I think most of them would you?
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk>
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably got to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you want <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this, the world would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or is maybe possible?
Evolution has been a wonderful theme here at the TED Conference but I want to give you a look of a doctor on the subject.
The great list of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing for biology, makes sense to the light of <unk>
But if they actually take biological evolution, consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It refers to others or <unk>
This is another look the tree of life.
The human part of this branch right on one end, is of course, the one that we most interested in.
<unk> of a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
Over the course there has been maybe 20 -- 25 species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but this is the same protein, which is <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry into the more bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> you know about the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully pristine environment for those bacteria.
It's warm and dark, unexplored is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort on its part.
It's really a quick way for bacteria to the occasional <unk> of some rush <unk> to the output.
But by the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help us digest nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We're in kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe <unk> <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've been <unk>
When I was just <unk> to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms each cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters of that cell cells.
But when organisms come up, things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And a very important thing -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one might say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death of <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at the time, but with every year she was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your <unk>
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a magnificent little dancer.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> in search of a <unk> <unk>
It's doing it say, George, I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working by a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only differently.
He was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to stay healthy.
I wanted to make health care in disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution is to move the genome to the next <unk> adapt and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think all of us -- the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to say <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily fail to longevity.
It doesn't necessarily serve the biggest or the stronger or the more quickly and even the smartest one.
Evolution favors the best adapted to its environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria -- the bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that we would find if there were fish there, fish out of <unk> and yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look ahead at the <unk> phase, I would say there are a lot of possibilities.
The first one is not <unk>
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the thinking underlying that would be that through medicine, in the first place, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been <unk> and disappear from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we were so excited that it's no longer possible to have the isolation of evolution.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of traditional traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when the species are <unk> distant planets are going to exist and the environmental changes that can produce the evolution of nature.
But there's a third possibility, a meaningful possibility -- intriguing and frightening.
I call this <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and the <unk> of us as individuals who are <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what is chosen at the individual and family level.
Think about that if you could not be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but, in your own body to make the genetic settings to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
Would you want to do those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990, and he sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs at a cost at a cost at 20,000 dollars and in a week.
It doesn't get a lot to make the human genome for <unk> and being more and more at the reach of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us, but they're going to induce <unk> immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial course with the vaccine <unk> on a cell plant plant cells.
You can imagine something nice to go out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the <unk> egg and giving their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating <unk> reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same technology -- that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is also going to allow us to also be able to engage <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get to the next generation of the machine machine.
Why don't you have a faster cycle muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in advance of pass this into the next generation and we could take the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take a hundred thousand years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next hundred years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to get to them.
We're going to use these options on an attempt for a better society, more successful, more successful.
Or, we're going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing of all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do is these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 meters tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds frightening.
Well, I had a single seat that day -- I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. We probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot would take the airplane on the Hudson River.
Often that's not the <unk>
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three more words you have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get to and I didn't did, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I wanted to repair and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that, later I came up with a sentence, which is <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll just set it up.
I don't want to hear you anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, that really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as the bridge -- George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, "I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also gave place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for time that it doesn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, like <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm no longer trying to have reason -- it's going to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14th <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please stand up.
I don't want this to break it in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> to that whole life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
In that point I understood when I understood those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
And over all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was offered a miracle of <unk> not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live differently.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens to you on your plane -- and for that it's not that -- but imagine, and how do you get it?
What is it that <unk> you still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and the negative energy on them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most cool thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day came to her house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, they have total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation -- obviously, the graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and to their cause.
So I went and I met her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "One second, is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be an important person and you can't really do that.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Did anybody see the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they go <unk> with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to me with the only desire to get a check, and rather than that signed a check I had no idea how he was going to <unk>
I love her brother and her father right there at the moment, "OK, this is the <unk> Tony <unk> -- we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inner can't be <unk>
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research Research -- that have a technology that allows you to project light on any surface and then with a laser pointer of that and the negative pointer of space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks of Bush and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in your <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move things on one side to another we had a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of insurance companies, and we get a machine so that you could make a machine -- like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy who gets an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the <unk> world of all over the corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, kids and I moved into the garage back and <unk> and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we would do something completely stupid and when they started, they would have removed the paintings from the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, I was able to go back to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my son, and we created this.
It's called <unk>
They are a pair of glasses of the cheap sun that we bought in the <unk> <unk> which is some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera -- we put it together on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it is free -- we published the <unk> code -- software goes down for free.
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say <unk>
There is no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the next person, and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And then over a year of planning, two weeks of programming myself intense sessions from all night, Tony went back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system and is looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot of the hospital.
And he turned to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust out in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti too.
And at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I ever drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody was finally coming up to <unk> and would me get me out there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to deal and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 invention of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up going to close the <unk> is that in April this year in April of <unk> in the center of Los Angeles -- there is to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, it can happen.
None of the stuff that there is in this room was possible -- the computer -- the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> <unk> I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people in order to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we find something feeling that we need to do. If it's not now, I mean, if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations in situations generally very difficult and at the same time a little bit dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days eating just this fun -- something difficult in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been tracking myself in situations in appearance horrible with the only goal to try to examine social questions in ways that are <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully analyzing them in a way that was seen and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'd come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights for the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I'd been doing is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk -- that you have no idea what it is and according to content could be held in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or his company as well.
But said this, it's a very good opportunity to do that.
You know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I had no tell you with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could happen to me, nothing could be done for something as difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that tried to <unk> <unk> and marketing and advertising, and that all the film is being made out of <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to be called "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie, you ever ever <unk> is that everything from the top at the bottom, in the end, you have images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is what? <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It was more by <unk>
It was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X mark in the title, but we're going to make sure that we were taking all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe it's going to take a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe than you've <unk>
The most cool car you've ever driven in "The largest film, ever <unk> the best drink of <unk> <unk> of "The largest film, ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> <unk> <unk> making it <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the complete idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how supportive is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> No <unk> David <unk> How much money does it take to do this?
MS: A million and a half -- <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big marks, a couple of big ones.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we see it as a lot of <unk> idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: Both of things.
MS: ... means that you're not really optimistic.
So, I was <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about which brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> meant we have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to show you the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media -- it's not the idea to tell with that new vehicle that's going to lead the message to <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no wrong.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image is.
See, when you look for pictures of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were showed.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line probably the bigger problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- even the CEOs the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really change something very suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that still still exist.
It's <unk>   Like this rare road path.
And it's very risky.
What else is it about?
They had a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell them we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want it to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want it to take a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would tell me in some lie -- and there he was looking at me as he used to say, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
Is your story, there is my story, and there's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, it would have to take off the proxy and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to figure out is that what I started to realize is that when you start talking to corporations the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, big, giant films that make small movies, like mine.
And my friends who make films of Hollywood movies say the reason why their movies are so successful because of the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm coming out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with somebody who can tell you you are cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You get a little bit nervous.
I want to help you make you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there he would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have his opportunity.
We are going to have so much for man like <unk> <unk> to <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the overall look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
We get to the kind of small movies that we are <unk> we are more well <unk>
So we don't have the budget to have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, you remind people -- is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
KF: That's a great question.
Volunteer: Technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you very cool.
How do you get fresh more time? With better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man of the street, to people like me, to <unk> <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: I mean, my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothes.
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk>
<unk> Something unique <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, many gray colors and things like that.
And usually I am wearing accessories as sunglasses, or like sunglasses, or <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, he would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: Part of <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys to pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be able to make Tom but I often hit the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could get into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If you could do it for them, you certainly could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of self.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you think about how people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you do.
All of those things come in place and start in a place and in my case, and in my case, they start in my family in West Virginia.
A: what's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: Next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way of being.
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like things different.
I like the weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about <unk> why is that?
What is <unk> What phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It was little more than you, who is not who you are.
What else are you <unk> you've <unk>
I don't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience, <unk> Great <unk> A: yeah. <unk> Thank you very much.) Thank you.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to get out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides, but <unk> on your personality of <unk> -- Morgan Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very well <unk> together.
And I think there's almost a paradox of them.
And I think some businesses will only become one of their strong dots or on the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be, and it's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid the fear, those elements -- and you actually <unk> you and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What else are you like this?
The first here is the Apple <unk> Apple.
And you can also see here in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands understand those things that have gone and come on, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: You know, what's your <unk>
If someone asks you to hold your identity out of brand, your personality of brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more good a killer <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful being cool as <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold as a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic as <unk>
Or are you more of perceived <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You are established, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> stable, family <unk> <unk> sacred. <unk> <unk> <unk> like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the end product.
So they allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we came to tell the story in this movie of how we now use MRI and to identify the desire centers in the brain so much for commercial marketing and for film.
We went to San Paulo where air advertising has been forbidden in the open.
In the entire five years, for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting way to the schools with available schools in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects where I have had the biggest answer or the ones that I've had more success are the ones I've ever been <unk> with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies are not very much interested in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that will make people think that is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did it gone? They succeeded.
Well, since the movie was sent in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies we talk about giving their customers not to be part.
I have always believed that if you get risks -- if you take risks that you have opportunities.
I think when you take people out of that, they're pushing them into failure.
I think that when you train their employees on loss aversion to be preparing all of their company to fund rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to not be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's go forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear -- <unk> at risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to keep the transparency.
More than a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk <unk> <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who <unk> bought the rights of name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data on big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check for the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my <unk> TED <unk>
The idea behind the <unk> worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
gray boxes don't use software software, they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus on Windows in a laptop a laptop used by a laptop to set up this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, right?
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
So that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we were <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they spent very weird things.
It was <unk> as a rat rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working in that <unk>
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than we would get to get the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the seizure code, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and big.
We also saw that they were highly familiar armed armed with people that obviously had all the internal information.
It took all the points to attack.
They probably even know how much they would bring back the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech and <unk> let me tell you, the load is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much as old <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to engage with the real world, with potential targets in the real world.
We need theories about allowing us to pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, remember that it's definitely an violent <unk> it must be a valuable, and they're certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
There are no several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them in and I ended up in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of <unk>
The rotor is that part of the mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal goal was to make it slow and <unk> in one obvious obvious effort to go crazy to <unk> engineers so they could not solve this quickly.
We are trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number <unk> stands out in that code, you can't get <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
It's almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
And this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
And so it's not <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been from a few weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to start again.
And yet, we discovered that both digital digital <unk> would be a single thing and same goal, but from different <unk>
The little girl is taking a <unk> and making you <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I really hated me.
There it is the gray box and the top of you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input values of the sensors and the sensor sensors, and provides the <unk> which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on video games.
It's <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just going to have the operators <unk> in the fourth control room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act quickly.
For example, in an energy plant, when the great steam turbine is going on speed, you have to open from escape.
Obviously, this cannot do it a human operator.
That's where we need digital safety systems.
And when you're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> nor the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in an energy plant, or a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> <unk> that disseminate this load of a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology from worms to <unk>
We get as much as possible.
And if you made that, with what you <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and better that we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assume that the <unk> is the key behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
This is the engine behind this is the <unk> superpower, is the <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in the way, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and have a <unk> abilities or another one that makes users of lawn chairs and walk back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing different than something that is put in the morning, it gives you a great force that also increases its speed, and helps for example, to handle balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other things <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on -- we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on his back of a 45 pounds, and you have to get it even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the matter.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> Human Genome <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can spend 90 pounds on variables for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I mean, what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and a <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's look back now look at the users of chairs on what I feel particularly <unk>
There are 68 million people like roughly, on a chairs of wheels around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, people with very young people, with the spinal cord that when you start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair it turns out to be its only choice.
We are also talking about the population that is rapidly divided quickly.
His only option, many times -- by brain injury, is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was at 19 years ago had an injury in the <unk> column and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the board on board on the back.
There's also some batteries that give energy to engines in <unk> and at the knees, and they make it move forward with this lovely, very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a stranger jump in the air, skiing across the bottom line was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all of feeling and all of the movement from filtering down.
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last bit of hope of my self.
The <unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it cost down in <unk> climbing rocks and even ride on a bicycle <unk>
But they've never invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but to all of the users of chairs and all of the <unk>
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos in Congo.
The bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their vivid living kin.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
As the chimps are dominated by big, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where violence is still not observed.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest and it's been very hard to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an Earth of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been sustained by decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction also put in danger of the Bonobo.
Trade has hunting and deforestation makes you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and, honestly, we're not quite sure.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes <unk> the love, the <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity given that the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a <unk> game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors of connections.
And when you look at the game, Bonobo sees the roots very hard by laughter, the dance and the human <unk>
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple unique videos of the wild.
First, it's a game <unk> <unk> <unk> and I don't talk soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what he's doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "You have <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common so much in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements in play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female -- who is playing with <unk> water.
I think, like her, sometimes we play alone, and explore the limits of our inner worlds and out there.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the realization that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world with more creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our adaptation.
To adapt to success to a world that changes have to play.
But <unk> our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
Play is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be the least appropriate appropriate times that you can be the most urgent thing.
So fellow primates, we will embrace this gift of evolution and <unk> together as they were, creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as an assistant.
And in our city, where volunteers were <unk> a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain of charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that we have certainly gone through one of the world's worst days of life.
We were in complete night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer who had just gotten before I was, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain first to the captain and he asked him to go back and put the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people I walked into a flying building to save a live being alive only because I won by five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, "I need to go home to the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and it brings this woman a pair of shoes."
Do you see it.
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hallway went to the fire firemen at that height or less they had finished off the fire and walked into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back through the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
We got out of the house the <unk> for the house owner where, as I would expect, his treasure. received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the <unk> owner for the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that somebody had ever reached a couple of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling to volunteer <unk> I'm witnessing the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also from grace and courage and courage in the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look in this room to people who have succeeded, or they're because they are making remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind me of this: not wait.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you will right now.
We used food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to influence someone's life.
So I trained the <unk>
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block there.
The first concrete blocks in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement modules from a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things larger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, we came up with this.
He called it <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to all the home.
It has been estimated that has been made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block of concrete in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create a much bigger circuits and more complex, one brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> <unk> the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't understand that the building blocks of our time are being reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're linked through magnets.
So you can't put the wrong wrong.
<unk> have a color code.
The green is the <unk> blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue one with a green and very quickly can start to make older circuits.
A blue one with a green one with a green make light.
We can put a button in the middle and have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse module. That's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, we are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make a little bit faster or <unk> you just turn this button that makes the pulse be faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's increasing increasing power.
We want all of the interactions in the world to become ready to use.
It sounds sounds like solar panels, it will save everything it must be accessible.
We have given <unk> to the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how you start understanding the electronics for every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light works at night, or why the door of an elevator is staying open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So, for example, designers without electronic electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the Rhode School of Rhode Island, who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard and paper and we said, "Let's ask something.
Here's an example of a project that has been done, an canyon.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that is a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interaction world, is ours.
So forwards and things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is to get involved with the environment in focusing on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a small video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
Can it take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I'm already going to be at time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
We put some members every year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of texting the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Your task is to show you the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a hydrant from the city of Boston.
Here it looks like if I was looking at a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody is caught by snow because he knows it's not very good by shooting fires when it's covered in a meter of snow.
How did he come to ask for the help in this way <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at the time we would spend a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens are going to go with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application in which you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you go.
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has an component uprising.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications of the last year.
But it does something that no other technology from the U.S. government.
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible system of <unk> City <unk> when you see this app realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people were stealing the batteries.
So he asks the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to get people to get themselves to clean sidewalks up.
So now we know about nine cities that plan using using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> and natural and natural <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen yet.
The acquisition of software generally takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that the normal channels have taken at least two and a half million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the <unk> power of California that the time has come over 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
And so an app that was program in a couple days and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot shot at the institution of the government.
It suggests the best ways to work with, not like a private business, like many people think it should be.
It's also not as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in an open way and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools for working together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people across the country that contribute to <unk> applications, every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up with the government.
They feel a big frustration for that, but they don't get into the <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings of politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> what we do together because it's not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government in last instance made out of -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way we think about it will affect the way we produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, above all, a question of <unk>
This is the center of online services and information.
It's the place that the calls is if you mark about the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> at the basis of official knowledge.
I did nothing. It started with animal control.
And then finally he said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put it very hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So fine by Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston is not a call center.
It has a mobile and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
We don't have that application.
It was the work of very smart people in the Office of New <unk> <unk>
One day, this really comes up with this <unk> <unk> in my trash, and I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
<unk> dynamics are different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I approached the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, fresh <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of government to distributed volunteer collaboration,
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological <unk>
I'm talking about a platform for people to behave and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key <unk>
I connected to two people.
And it might be connected to the government services that we need but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than government services.
When one neighbor helps another one, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people have it, but they think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input is the <unk>
How many times have we chosen a <unk> leader sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we expect the government to take our values and really reinvent our needs, but then we don't see any changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what it holds to us that we have been involved as something that is operating in our <unk> that other thing, and the consequence is losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy to be <unk>
Because that's where the real job of government works.
We have to collaborate with the government.
That makes the movement <unk>
You've got them <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That is not political activism is <unk>
And for those of us who have been <unk> to the government, it's time for us to ask what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the root function of government that can be able to expand civil society into society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act -- just to articulate the systems of the right way.
The average age of our members is from 28 years so that I do, I am a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to talk about, they're going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when the government problem doesn't care about to do hear their voices.
They're using their hands.
They put hands in the work to program applications that make it work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out -- dumping down a garbage bucket that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only as consumers, we are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until you don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or we'll also be a <unk>
Thank you.
This is a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in the communities in the face of projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
Instead, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach you with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can do a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of the law, my work.
I learned my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional Indian house, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all sorts of discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery in slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but she was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and he looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and I said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I was moving back again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Instead, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and their attention.
My cousins were running around everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all of my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I initially thought it was a game.
So he looked at her and said, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up through the room, he took me out through the room, and he said, "Come <unk> The two will be <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell anyone about it.
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't hear him, I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and I looked down, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "I just want you to do three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is you always want your <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to prove it that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so he <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you're always going to do the right thing if right as right is it?
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I did it."
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I was never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so he <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South rural. I have a brother a older year and a sister a <unk> sister.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and I went for the forest.
We just got to do the <unk> of the time.
He took a drink of beer, he offered my sister, she took my sister, she took a little bit and offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today <unk> and you always do the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister also.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's up? It takes a <unk>
He went into the <unk> <unk> and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tell all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
Let me tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to think that it's a <unk> I say that by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that can't be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that we had to do with it, as we had to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of three black people in the 18 and the 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, <unk> Philadelphia, Central Washington, <unk> 50 to 60 percent of all young color in jail or <unk>
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and innocent than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is what the results are.
And it seems like we are very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not ours.
We're <unk>
It seems to me interesting.
We're looking at our work with some pretty curious developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you will be fed up of rights forever, if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has probably lost the right to vote.
And if we put it into the next 10 years the level of loss of food loss will be as high as it was before you put the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where <unk> children will die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, no possibility of getting out.
Right now we are in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They sell people to the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense of sense, they have given us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by <unk> crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death penalty is defined by mistake.
Out of every nine people who have identified this is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death row.
A mistake, error, <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never be able to fly by flying airplanes if from every nine that would be <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history -- I talk about slavery.
I tell you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that went to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined its lives.
Now there are more people who are coming up to me and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you determine talks, <unk> <unk> to people who stop saying that in our history of the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with the segregation and decades of <unk> race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And this is why we haven't done the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we would get to each other.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome race without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done that.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's pretty disturbing to listen to what I <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We can never be here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There's no way for our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, and <unk> and <unk> we put people to <unk>
Let's get it on this.
How do we get into a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
And I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. We love creativity.
We love entertainment.
But then in those realities they are punished by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both things.
Today we talk about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more <unk> with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> those who never come to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's within our self.
We have to believe in issues we haven't seen before.
That's how we are. In spite of being so rational, so consistent with the intellectual thing.
The innovation with innovation, the development comes not only about ideas of brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that come from the <unk> of the heart.
This connection of your mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be on despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There's no related to technology and design, that allowed us to truly be humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, by injustice.
Now I want to suggest that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a young lawyer from meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to talk about.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes out the <unk>
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. Be lady.
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, let me tell me this is that idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving it my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted unfairly.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and the end of the end, and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> were very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> got my finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk>
I think that the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst than we have to do.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't trust you, it's not that it's a <unk>
But even if anybody kills another one, it's not a <unk>
And so I think there's a basic dignity in the people that should be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, for our designs, or our intellectual capacity or rational capacity.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not because of the way they deal with the rich and powerful and <unk> but because of the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it is in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond me in a major way.
I've been representing these kids that have been convicted of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients at 13 and 14 years, that have been <unk> so they were <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what isn't it?
The judge made it as an adult, but I see a child.
One night I was very late was <unk> by God, if the judge can turn you into something you are, you must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for something about that.
As it was too late I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> <unk> a small poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black client to be treated as a privileged grade of 75 years executive from a <unk>
In the <unk> I put that there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or a really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> it had been sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I was truly <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car to end to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man <unk> it was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who are you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And so I got away and <unk> me.
And I was standing in the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I walked into the audiences.
When I came in, the judge saw me.
And he said to me, <unk> Stevenson, and he wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> me." And we started contacting myself.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the cops the police, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and all of all, because we're talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I hit the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would just look through the window and try to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black black, with a lot of worry, walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table table.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> showed <unk> because the <unk> had entered in the room.
The <unk> ran over the old black man."
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black guy stood up, looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this audience audience to tell this young man who would keep his view in the target with <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds down to justice.
That we cannot be truly human beings, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
Our survival is attached to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must lead to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you here who share this, I simply want to tell you that keep the view of the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You try to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes, to do something.
Something that's not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There's several opportunities for you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to get involved in order for the funding that you spend today on the policy of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death penalty in the next five years, billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> are not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes don't come to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to make the law to make the law of security.
I think there is a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the reason is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you who you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big <unk> growth in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war on Drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince us by the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the <unk> chain, to rob a bicycle, by small crimes against property -- instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment doesn't do anything for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've excited to talk to us today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats by Bin Bin Laden.
<unk> 2: <unk> in Somalia.
<unk> 4: <unk> <unk> <unk> 5: Go!
<unk> 6: <unk> social <unk> globally, 65 people dead.
<unk> 8: <unk> <unk> 9: <unk>
Several <unk> War, the <unk> mass destruction.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> Death <unk>
Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media would prefer to call negative news because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are receiving many, many more data than the brain probably can be able to <unk>
And like nothing matters more than survive, the first stop all of this data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the danger.
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
And so from a <unk> of <unk> stories look at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there are blood <unk> it's very true.
And given that all digital devices give us negative news, seven days per week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be bad at worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is embedded in such a way that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the <unk> lack of water and <unk> we have no doubt them.
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems, and in the long time, we just ended up with them.
So let's look at what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita income has been <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has been reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food food, transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy happened 25 to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people would have it.
And we keep getting higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> TV, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It's a lot of this technology -- and then in this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we put into information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of price in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile thing you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and peace, in the war and peace, in recession and peace, in recession and <unk>
It's a quick computer analysis used to build faster computers.
It's not stopping for any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it's coming up on the top.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
<unk> in cloud, which my <unk> call computing computing and sensors and their ability to democratize and its ability to democratize it all over the planet -- synthetic biology, fuel fuels and food, digital medicine, digital medicine -- <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw victory in "Jeopardy" of Watson, <unk>
It was spade.
I was looking at the newspapers the best headline that I would have.
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
They were going to have the nuances of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to all on the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean creating life <unk> for each other <unk> it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that's poor and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that unleashes resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The Napoleon troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of <unk> to Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it were <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that has been moving for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get on the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about painful, but about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. <unk> parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents a national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have plenty of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed into the Voyager <unk> to the Earth, in 1990, after I grew up <unk>
<unk> a famous photo, how do you get <unk>
"A pale <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought through the water <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to get a little bit of the technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a tiny, small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any credible source, saltwater, contaminated water, for less than two cents a gallon.
And the president of Coke just thought that I'm going to make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola is going to be able to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an effective innovation because of this technology that exists today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile phones in the middle of Kenya that the Reagan President was 25 years ago.
And with a smart phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video -- images of books and music, technology, diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when you get health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X X <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world so that we are challenging these technologies on a mobile device with the talk, and because it has <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses that a protective team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> load is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a <unk> virus or DNA that wouldn't be able to call the <unk> and first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk> billion degrees.
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we will go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds that are never before they add to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you do? What a <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the biggest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health through the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy -- and because of 3D impressions and media in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we bring three billion more of human humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
What about a few voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard and being able to act for the first time?
What about these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions we can't afford them.
One thing I learned with the X prize is that small, guided by his passion with a clear goal, they can do things -- things that before they could only do the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end up with sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing to medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played with this <unk> professors between others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined each other, and they started <unk>
And it has shown that today the recognition machinery of human patterns is better -- <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me enormous trust in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of innovative <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are focused on to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the point of departure.
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I would give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
They actually pick fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
I caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story many times about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: <unk> of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned too much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, in some mangroves.
There were <unk> about 20 degrees, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so you made more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the amount of fish had declined in half.
I went to the five inches.
You get a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they still were happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fisheries, in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe, done a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was to impose into countries that had 100,000 dollars -- <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this kind of kind of kind of ugly, it was called The <unk> four.
I went to fish in it, and we had studies in the South China Sea, <unk> and, above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most fish are <unk> tiny things about <unk> remains that are <unk>
In short, the bottom of the sea came to cover and then <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start commercial fisheries.
The bottom line happens to be a strong coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I wasn't still <unk>
So they wanted to do it, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are, every time they go to a area where they have never fish.
But there is no <unk>
They spread the world, but we don't remember.
It was the starting point -- on the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things that are <unk> biodiversity, as many <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't see the loss that happened before.
You can analyze some of the changes.
And at the end I keep on the <unk>
And that, in a large extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer -- or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies have killed animals without knowing what they have done to a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very abundant before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Eventually, we focus on the big animals, and in a synonymous with large fish.
They become little <unk> because they were <unk>
You have a few fish, but we think that's the point of departure.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence was presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect that to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of us who are looking at -- like captain just looking at a lot of fish in this area can't be used or usually they don't use the scientists of fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Out of the enormous paper that can fulfill a protected marine zone.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and is extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a marine protected area and they can benefit from the vision that we can <unk> which allows them to erase it.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may be able to fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the harbor Bay Bay years ago.
And you may have noticed that the nuanced and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why is it <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that I'll give you is <unk> do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are doing viral and how important it has to be.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
Over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And, of those, just a small percentage of those, a little bit viral gets lots of visits and wins <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities and factor.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the rise of last summer.
<unk> didn't stop doing a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this talk that I would take a video to the video of the <unk>
The <unk> like Jimmy <unk> and they present to us with new and interesting public <unk>
Rebecca <unk>  He's on Friday, I have to start on a Friday.   Everyone wants to get the end of week, the end of a week.   A Friday. <unk> a Friday.  KA: We're not going to think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart is often <unk>
Like <unk> <unk> <unk> this video seemed to come out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, actually.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday, this particular Friday, right?
Well, he took him <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about video video games.
But what's important is that one person or a group of trends are taking a point of view, and they share it with a more broad audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this big, internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an amateur animation with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats will see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity I woke up among the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an version of the old age.
And then it was international made.
Suddenly a whole community of remix, that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or RS: Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written to <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video goes up two days per minute, only the really unexpected and unexpected can be made of the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great clip of a guy that protest against <unk> to riders in New York, I will admit that I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey Casey <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but often there are obstacles that will prevent you properly on the <unk>
KA: Thank you to the effect of its humor, Casey <unk> I got five million to see and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing we make in creative form.
And all of this leads to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities creative communities are very unexpected, are features of a new kind of media, that we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started YouTube.
Don't get permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little bit masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media, but it's barely the current media -- but we will tell you the entertainment entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope and freedom of their country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> facing the fact that her life had been totally in vain.
And the words, for so much time, friends, now I'm going to do it.
They are <unk> in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that story tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn -- it's going to go back to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined for a task -- the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do that.
And then from a four years of <unk> the fiction, a boat slid into the sea dressed up to sea ship.
Every adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the pirate rape and death of death.
As most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were asked first, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of motor, the <unk> <unk> in every wave, and the vast skyline of a vacuum.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to break out for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil shelf in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who had collapsed and died, I end up the journey was too much to get it, and the first apple that I tried given by the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, they <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is made of immigrant <unk>
Unlike the middle class of middle class whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> were traded between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a assembly line, working six days, <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in I.T. <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, wouldn't mind what it ought to be <unk> which was usually <unk> <unk> was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> would go back home."
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
He was accumulating determination and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> our grandmother's movements in the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my job was to be wakes up until her nightmares that they started to be able to get it on.
She opened a computer shop, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who were able to do the angry transition and <unk> and <unk> boys -- trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
They were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was a classic classical student, relentless for what I was looking at myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in life, increasingly, <unk> by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many people got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of school, I was elected the Jewish woman in the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle in the other, but its edges will not exist.
So <unk> <unk> <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited invited to speak on sites that had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the comfort and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters just ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do that.
It reminded me that I had the same age that she had when she got into the boat.
The "no" had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, and you won't be anything that doesn't <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about it, the more it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were living on on the border of as possible.
And even though I ended my journey, I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> new in the scene -- and not only is it right, but it's something that is being grateful, perhaps a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave those enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> who didn't have been <unk> were <unk> tremendously.
There was a power there, a <unk> optimism -- a rare mix of humility and courage.
So I followed my intuition.
I went to a small group of people who can't <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a dime.
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant pot of soup that everyone <unk>
They went to well at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, we opened up.
I made a decision to move to the U.S.
It's after one journey.
My feel again.
Three months later I had <unk> and adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared for.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother was <unk>
Without the support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
The can't proved to be wrong.
He was in the shower in a hotel room, when she died, 1,000 miles into <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell her stories, and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You've got <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because those who we were and how life came to us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that for you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy, of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, <unk> brave in each wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to it, and you can see them a lot of it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, in the <unk> sky, with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was born, the great prince warrior -- the Indian warrior -- I was <unk> I was able to pull a bow and a <unk> to the ground, get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we removed was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And so I was very upset.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
And I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic, not kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this kind of technological <unk> was for my most magic.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them out of <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> I came back to this technological world to see how we use it to create magic, rather than kill her.
I was sending books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where do we are.
Put the text with the image, that animation, sound and touch.
storytelling becomes more and more <unk>
But what does that do for us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And this --  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
At various times it comes to a <unk> the iPad knows where I was alive because of GPS -- that comes back to me.
My inner girl are excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they light your way into the <unk> of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by girl was that a whole galaxy was born in a <unk>
So here every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag towards this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
And in all textbook there has always been maps of it, but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book that are also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another important aspect to me is to create Indian content and a contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We all have heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra over millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's story.
In a history that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure that you have to go out there, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> and stones, stones, and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to recover this whole ritual of childhood you have to go out and in a chapter, a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child from India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Some of the connection variations between magic, Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and video on and actually augmented it through a group of cartoons that appear on the interior plants inside the house.
And at a moment, the screen is full of paper.
And you have to do the sound of wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where nature forces in nature are focused on technology and magic and technology and <unk>
It's called the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a head of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or you asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think this is one of the biggest problems that all of us -- or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk> It's a very simple thing.
It's got a doorknob from on and closed <unk>
Every morning I was hooked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to 95 percent <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I gave me sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So, he can see what my problem problem is not at the same time when you need <unk> or a kind of urgency of that style -- but you see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi <unk> and before up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and so that patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be able to move people on their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people who are <unk> from their homes, to take their own blood pressure, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, go back to control and become captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges we face, as the firing of attention costs <unk> the demand for demand and other issues.
We have techniques that are very simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video.
We all have <unk> controls in <unk>
Maybe we even have on our cell phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> ATM ATMs are.
So where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the <unk> closest to help this patient?
We asked them, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please make it <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up at times in the office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> we were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and to the next weeks to use his cell phone phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I want to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to be <unk> globally.
We are <unk> to all of the colleagues in the world, on other universities, to help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
And I'd also like to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
It could be messaging or <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in its place.
Please hold it in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15.
It was mixed with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me photography I had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
Let's get it up like this: a construction on a very crowded road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of reality.
Or they were pictures like <unk> dark and colorful and the common goal of keeping the art level.
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want you to seem captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be able to capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what's the trick that makes them look true.
Are the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What is it that creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the basics is very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's compare to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's actually to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like a picture of it, I think it's those in which we don't even understand the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs it's very important to talk about it, because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are combined to make the same kind of light.
And these two images are done with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of different images with a perfect act.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely composed of photographs of different places.
In the personal I think it's easier to create a place that you find is because you don't need to put the ideas on the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try and find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are different location.
The <unk> was captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, I even made the red house house to seem more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome I think it takes planning.
You start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result might be very beautiful, and at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details of the general place.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of microprocessors versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like a lot of other people we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents a order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves -- is something new.
Here's something strange here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because I wrote about paper.
Why should we have technological curves at <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve where you say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any of the technology that I would like to give you the diagram would look something ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look at for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something happens to be something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology is as fast as the last <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of economic growth that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to do is -- looking at these <unk> curves -- we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
<unk> one of two things.
Or it's okay to become a curve as this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, that's why I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask is, what is that new way that <unk> the world?
Why new world is the world going.
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're engaged in it.
I remember a kid, the future happened in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future is <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
That happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate that we are doing today no sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that we be <unk>
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The time scale that I would like to do is this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back a few two and a half billion years when the Earth was a great rock rock with a lot of chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way those chemicals organized we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at that time, there was a few oil <unk> with all kinds of chemicals inside it.
Some of those drops of oil held a particular combination of chemicals that were made to bring out materials on the outside and so the droplets grew up growing up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> mobile forms of oil.
But those blobs were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you were <unk> they would have a spread distribution of the chemicals that they <unk>
That's why every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow became better at the time of bringing chemical chemicals into <unk> more <unk> more chemicals and more <unk> more.
They usually lived, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, and it was very simple, but things become interesting -- interesting when these blobs learned the trick.
In some ways that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved a half a half billion years.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I'm trying to hide from the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk> it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and it would have spread in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things would be very different in which things were very different and it was that these cells started trading and communicating information forming information and cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So, for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way they can avoid penicillin and they would get them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to get into communities that in a way, were together in it, and a <unk>
From that <unk> or <unk> together, or it was that if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community were <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities got so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community board on a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage we have communities that are <unk> communities from many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells who don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or the brain of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that don't make more than process information in community.
They're neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that you process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures of understanding and to convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gives you an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the length of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism can, for example, learn to not eat some fruit because I knew bad and sick to the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that before they had built these information processing structure that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit <unk>
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures that accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick.
So, for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea.
I'm here sitting here by sitting around with <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads, that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take a very complicated thing to turn it into sound, in sound sequences, and produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to make abstractions.
Now we spend a similar amount of periods of periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer -- the computer tape -- the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings together into something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen at <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of history that would tell you taken a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
Some of them, the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And then again, like electronics, like electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without the recent <unk>
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers, <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction -- we put it in the machine and machine with that it does something that before you can't do it, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using is evolution itself.
So we put inside the machine in an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions on chance?
You could run these random instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those who more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them made it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences better than the <unk>
We get those and <unk> to the rest.
And now let's get the best numbers on the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> on a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will fill the properties.
So we managed to get a new generation of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
They went back again.
<unk> some mutations ...
And it tries to try and bring it back to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or complex cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that report numbers in a perfect way.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
They are dark programs.
But do the <unk>
In fact, yes, I have the security that you get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
One time I was in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a flight flight, you don't feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex things that produces normal engineering.
But we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they were <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog time to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our part of thinking that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of creating whatever it is.
But now comes lunch and I think it will stop here before I get stuck.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that is me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give up a part of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I was dealing with my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
<unk> is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about coming out of the <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and to form a large baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> we have to fill on 300.
That means the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball to the game of play without being <unk> and that anybody who tried to <unk> the first base, not to get time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three 10.
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Grand <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how you call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody that 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like the <unk> Ted Williams, the last player at the <unk> League <unk> in running more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I'm going to ask this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you have a surgeon who has also a <unk> record in <unk>
That's how it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a distant place, and a loved thing has two <unk> <unk> <unk> and his family doctor derives to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But do you know something?
And she is actually getting very much better.
And its hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'm going to ask you.
What do you think to be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
They're very good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do is, however, is <unk> the world, and I would be included with the parasite engine.
You never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I had when I was in medical school.
I was a student <unk> <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman science was a <unk>
Just like which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses at the General Hospital at Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnosing <unk> frequent and the <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> of <unk> about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if you were going to do everything, then you would know it, or as we can close to everything, because this is how I get away from the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto, when they brought the emergency room to the emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I was a emergency room to talk to a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient.
I will report to the head of the residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides -- which was sent to me with heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of <unk> the blood forward, the blood goes into your lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that you would call it.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave it <unk> oil pills so that it could eliminate liquid them.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I really made two more errors actually.
He sent her home without talking to the head of the residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, I would have been able to bring up information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
I may not want to be a resident going to take care of care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without contact with my boss.
The second error I made was worse.
By the house, he had no attention to a voice on my inside that said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse to the nurse, "Do you think it's okay if he goes to his home?"
And the nurse thought, and then he said, <unk> <unk> "Yeah, I think I'm going to be okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he wrote the high <unk> and the ambulance next to the ambulance with the ambulance with her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach.
I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I went back to leave the hospital and walked down to the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that moment I did something that I didn't do normally, I did it.
I went through the emergency room on the way home.
And there was another nurse, not that <unk> of Mrs. <unk> before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most of the doctors in emergency emergency.
Other specialists are also afraid of them, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
He remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
After one hour of having come to her house, after I had a high school, she suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance of the <unk> with a <unk> <unk> pressure of <unk> which means a shock of severe <unk>
It's just just breathing and blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and I was hoping against all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that never <unk>
He had permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of what they die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks later, I was passionate about it, and I experienced for the first time <unk> that exists in our medical culture, and I felt just <unk> <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
That's that shame that leaves teaching.
<unk> that I talk about is that we feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't because of my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take things and made sure that I didn't get sick.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made it such a <unk>
So why chose medicine?
Gradually, that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day they opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you get the efforts to be perfect to make no more mistakes that they would do for those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was teaching in the emergency department in a city hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little <unk>
He took him penicillin and he sent him home.
But as he ran to the door he was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he gave the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in the <unk>
He came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google -- it's an infection, not the throat, but it's upper airline and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, not <unk>
You can get antibiotics antibiotics and <unk> and recovered in a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times on the same turn of the <unk> we don't get <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of them.
It was an X-ray of kidneys but it turns out, a colleague who was checking the patient to be checking some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with lots of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I looked at it and when I saw a certain sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, I called a surgeon.
Both of them were operated on and they recovered well.
But every case <unk> me <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful has been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't help you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tell me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show this that they don't make the same <unk>
If I walked into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after dies after failure?
Of course at a party you will hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also -- that a <unk> in my hospital -- the wrong leg -- trust me he would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> that they make mistakes and the ones that don't don't sleep and the ones that I know; they have <unk> and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you stop medicine to people who make mistakes, we will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical <unk> and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto <unk> to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes are happening every day, where one in 10 drugs in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where respiratory infections are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 people die by <unk> medical errors -- <unk>
The U.S. Institute in America established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so here's things.
A self-organizing system where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't care about it.
<unk> deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in his chest, and it comes to <unk> eyes, and with breath of alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get rid of it, and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, I'm not going to be anyone.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> white, white, art, <unk> -- it's my worst <unk> I would tell everyone, from the ambulance to the head of surgery, <unk> <unk> this is my worst <unk> blah, "What are your <unk> and you get the microphone towards them.
And his students were <unk> <unk> <unk> his head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They can say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The doctor <unk> human is human, they accept it, they accept it and not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and in a loving way that everyone is <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are running the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human. I'm a human.
And I feel so much but I strive to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take one day to <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
And I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that he says to pick up an American, are about 70 to a day.
Not long ago in a research continued for a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks by these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions that are <unk>
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> work.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only a 12 percent required for an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do you pick up the way that we're making those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choice for the seed <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like <unk> raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, this <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated at least in that time was very sophisticated.
He was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to the grocery store, but I was asked by one occasion, why never buy anything?
This is the shelf of <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in a box -- that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I said, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
He took a place for <unk> right to the shop.
We put there <unk> <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when they were <unk> a year 60 percent, when there was only six percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
Where he stopped when there was only three percent to buy <unk>
We saw when there was six, we saw 30 percent <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found 24.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have less good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices is affecting us in a good <unk>
We decided to do not to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions on savings for retirement and about a million American Americans, between 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of hedge funds in savings plans for retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found out that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds, there were less participation.
So if you look at the extreme ends, we see that in the plans they offer two funds, the rate of participation was from 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that he offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for the ones that decided to participate, the bigger the number of choices, more people will be killed by avoiding actions or investment.
In terms of the more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize financial financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to offer them more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that we make the decisions that <unk> even when this is against self-interest.
They are more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, and in health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it goes better.
The main reason is that we are looking at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to <unk> contrast and choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you a little bit of four simple techniques that we've collected in one form or another, in different research, so they can test in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more than today, less than it is.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But what we're seeing is what we're looking at more and more is that if you choose to cut, getting rid of <unk> exotic options, there will be an increase in sales, but the costs, will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> I eliminated out the products for cats of cats, <unk> that are increased <unk> in <unk> by two major <unk> sales and lower costs.
You know that retail today, on average, offer <unk>
In a <unk> shop there are about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the current world is <unk> and it provides only <unk> <unk> a kind of tomato sauce in tin.
In the financial savings world, I think that one of the best examples that have come about how to handle the choices is the <unk> David <unk> the show of Harvard.
All the Harvard employees are actually automatically automatically into a certain of life.
The people who are really willing to choose, are providing them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are options <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't make their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a few holidays with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want the <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you an applause if you're ready to take the <unk>
<unk> <unk> OK. Anybody who is ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really did hear more hands.
All right.
You actually had more information on the first round, which in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more <unk>
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the seed overload that's <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be very specific in a very specific way.
Why is people spend 15 percent more on average, when they use credit card or credit than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look real money.
It turns out that to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> staff who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting exactly how we were <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was to give you the staff who would think of the positive things that would be involved in your lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their bank accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine <unk>
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> along the <unk> corridor, the exhibition of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds of <unk>
But you know?
Because the classification tells me how to get it?
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is a <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is a <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This overall framework is totally useless.
<unk> should tell you something about who we were not going to do the <unk>
And you often see this problem with these huge lists of funding.
I was supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good <unk> decision buying a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that allows us to completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that each one.
<unk> outside of the car. It's 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is cause the order to make the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what about <unk>
How much involved you are.
If the default button is always <unk> it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who go from a lot of choices are <unk> the default button over and over again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options on many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the pick box is not to say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to make them clear out alternative <unk> <unk> -- we can handle <unk> we can handle more categories of <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I have introduced them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful that we can be in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1960s in the East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter I had to write it to the government.
I had to record a text of example written with the machine.
And this so that the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, so much that this is going to make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and it prints a page, that page will end up having some yellow little print on every page that you follow a pattern that makes your own pattern and your printer.
That's going on today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
The <unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to earn a lot of money, large amounts.
There are really many cases of online <unk> online, <unk> that would take money from their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their long-term loads, but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal people out of our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a <unk> computer.
The U.S. secret service two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> millions of dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be bad at worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of suicide bombers that we see today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate you the protests, motivate them to motivate laughter to you.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a major role in online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that do it to protest and the last group are the United States of the United States of the U.S.
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority on the Netherlands, or actually it was.
<unk> the last fall of doubled because of a <unk>
You put the safety of the site and attack a <unk>
I was asked last week -- I asked myself in a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is an infectious authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that they were going to have a foreign fight.
And that was going to be <unk>
And in the case of <unk> happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt in Egypt -- the headquarters for the Egyptian secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government, tools to intercept a large scale of the citizens of the citizens of the country.
They had been sold by 500,000 euros a <unk>
The headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this.
For example, in Germany, only a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are suspicious in a case of criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it's more there.
You would put the connection to the Internet.
We were able to get even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and to listen online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like the obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument makes no sense.
It's in play my privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to do today, will be forever.
Are we going to hear in any future government, in a administration that we might have in 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the South Africa in Nairobi.
These are the cows from my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no way around the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and the whole land and so we value it so much.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
People were dying they protect our community and livestock and they also are mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions were afraid.
But I realized that this doesn't actually <unk> because even the lions were helping the lions see the pen <unk> away.
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick lions so they believed it was close to <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came to the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, the lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on the turn that lights up and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
It will save everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity into the little box -- I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights out.
As you can see, the <unk> get out of the outside, because that's where lions.
And this is how lions look like, when they come in night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never came back to have a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses have heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot of time.
And my idea is also used now by a whole Kenya, to frightening other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also being used to list elephants from farms.
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping raising money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to get it?
So a year ago, I was just a kid in meadows from the savanna <unk> my father, and I used to see airplanes flying airplanes and said that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got a chance to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when I started.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows and my dad and lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't know how exciting is to hear a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in other electrical inventions.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electric electric -- a near <unk>
<unk> I know that they were already invented <unk> but I want to make my own.
CA: You know, I would do it once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I was trying to get a <unk>  CA: At the course of Richard <unk> you are a big thing.
We are going to take it in every step that I would have my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Don't <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I was asking about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything suddenly changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And he said, "When you do this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
He was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At a little time, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms watching his own face, without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine was <unk> from North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few they survived eating grass, insects and tree.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except by the sea lights in China, just across the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea picture in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that over the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as refugee farmers.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination around North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was done when I was arrested by Chinese Chinese and <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had been accused for being <unk> so I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and put the questions.
At the end of the day, one officer told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum.
But many can be arrested by Chinese Chinese and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though those were eventually released after a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape a lot of other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, everybody can get it in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hide my identity, I decided to take a <unk> going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of divide.
I even went through a crisis of identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with pride of mine.
Although I went to the life of South Korea -- it wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started to study for the entrance to college.
Just when I was starting to join my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family, and as blame, my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to run away from immediately.
I began to plan how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and walked to the border to North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to do it somehow, for over 3,000 kilometers through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and dealing with a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of you and started asking them questions.
As my family could not understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> and I stood up and told him they were people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We made it all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe border C.O.s in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I made everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance from the South Korea.
I was going and came in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two Koreans and to get them out of prison.
I read with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why would I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, a new hope, a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when I think more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the international community are really the strength of hope that the village <unk> needs.
With the time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea, and I joined them.
But getting their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language practices for work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us continue in contact with family <unk> and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> food, fast, <unk>
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed it to South Los Angeles -- as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is South Angeles --  <unk> -- fast food, fast <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center for the places of food to take and eat in the car.
What's curious about is that the places of food to lead kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in Los Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I would notice that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go from house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and the solution.
In addition to me I got tired of driving a few minutes to go back to buy an apple that doesn't have any pesticides.
What I did, was planting a forest of food in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's from 45 feet -- x three me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes on wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, L.A. Green -- we put together and started planting our food forest trees -- <unk> trees -- you know, the nine green vegetables.
What we do is, we are kind of a group paid by <unk> made by gardeners of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone <unk>
The city got me on top and <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made a <unk>
And I said, "Come on it?
A court order by planting food on a piece of land that no one was <unk>  And so I was like, "Okay, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green Green members who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of dry terrain.
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough enough to plant <unk> million plants of <unk>
Why does the hell do not look like?
It was a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars to result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there. I got my kids there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to give you my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
Such a <unk> artist <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You get rid of seeing what the Earth can do, if you leave her canvas.
You just can't imagine what amazing is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a education tool in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You try to see how kids affects guys.
<unk> is the <unk> act and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one time that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night and were in my garden, and I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> doesn't understand that people will steal your <unk>
What I say, "No God is not afraid you go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at his time, I want you to get her <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared his stories about how this had affected it, and how they used to plant with her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed it, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had like 50 people who come from, work and <unk> every volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow some <unk> you will eat <unk>  But if none of these are <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects the mind and the body, eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing that you're caught. I see color kids who are on this way designed for them, which doesn't take it anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids to train these communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take them and turn them into healthy.
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because it's not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work on people, take the guys out of the street, to know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening the farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you want them to take your <unk> OK?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, you know, if you want to see me, I'm not calling me, if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some crap.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>
It's made from <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that you would have.
And especially if you go on the <unk> and these cars go by, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, you'd want a quiet road <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt road roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has <unk> and water can go through it, so all the rain water flow into the sides and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't get water anymore.
The noise will be disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very high, all the <unk> noise, so it's a very quiet road <unk>
It also has a <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> See that on this road the stones from the surface goes out.
First of all, a stone, then more and more and more, and so forth, and <unk> -- well, it's not going to do that.  But you can damage their <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
Oh. It's ready.
And you know, of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how the damage comes into this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and <unk>
So, if you drive along the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use <unk> <unk> of that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel <unk> into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of <unk> steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to give you a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat up the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones will spread back to the surface.
So I used to have a <unk> oven, because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven. It's a similar system.
I put the sample that I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested a lot of samples there, and then the government, you really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to get it.
So we set up a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> freeway that we had to do a lane test to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of load on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can do this many times.
Well, in closing, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers that actually increase the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, you can even double the life of the surface -- actually will save a lot of simple money on very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about this as well.
We still have the sample here. It's quite hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how it behaves it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up <unk> one morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening <unk> News on his little gray radio.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those time, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban had been moved from Afghanistan and they made it illegal to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to get to my older sister who could no longer be used to go out to a secret school.
It was the only way we could get to them.
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could be suspicious where we were headed.
We had to hide the books in some of the market to make it look like shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us were in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every time in a while, school suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you live."
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters were <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so her father would get it.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It was back two years ago, just to convert our home in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk to educate your children.
Over the years of the <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you help leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do.
So, you still want to do it yet.
Today, I am 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than <unk> and if my family had not been so engaged in my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I found myself here proud to graduate in my College here.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from her home to educate her daughters, it was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just get away from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who I'm driving on the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm a global ambassador, <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls going to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I look at their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> by them, despite the same as opposed to a <unk> opposition.
As a <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but I can't show you his face, but I can't show you the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went on the road from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped being killed by a pump on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you are the phone, a voice would pick you out that if he was still sending her daughter to school, they would return to it.
He said, "but if he said, "but not damaging the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> ideas."
What I have realized from Afghanistan, and is something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are born, there's a father who recognized the value of her daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been the key to our success.
In fact, they often are the first compelling players of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school are told, remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
We assumed that these changes did not last long after the U.S. troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who were paying for them, that <unk> I see a future <unk> and <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities and <unk> and every day the girls in <unk> would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the revolution broke inspired by the <unk> of massive <unk> and massive <unk> and <unk> revolution.
One forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men -- they were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the inevitable regime, freedom and social justice.
You have shown an courage <unk> the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and some loss of about 50 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have wanted together with a lot of other women, rebuild civil society, <unk> a sustainable transition to democracy and national reconciliation, <unk>
There were about 200 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> almost 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I came back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about developing skills and skills of leadership.
With an amazing group of women we founded the Women's <unk> movement, the <unk> of the movement of women, leaders, it's a movement of <unk> to advocate for the food autonomy of women and for our right to participate in building democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> that is getting away from the selfish policies of domination and exclusion.
And over time, our initiative was <unk> and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of murder of the U.S. ambassador and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the U.S. officers in the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their appalling rapes of human rights <unk> and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, shaped by a technical mindset, more and more removed from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here at all here today to <unk> with our success story of <unk> <unk> and the elections.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, and we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and candidate peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> as much as women like for women?
Maybe what was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and creating consensus than the election needed the election -- which only would have the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the immersive performance of the most more than you need to be able to be able to be able to make the representation of representation and <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of disgust and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not just <unk> but also putting in practice <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> of war, desperately needs to have the end of achieving peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between female perspectives and the male men.
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of the <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that spans all of the humanity that men and women, which all tribes and all the peoples are <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers completely <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is all the existence of it.
So you can tell us, "My <unk> looks like all the things."
So this is how "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
They will all tell them the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a ridiculous question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everyone makes you ask. Why is she left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, and no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor in the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times the man, that I created my alma mater, <unk> to the head with a <unk> charged with bullets <unk>
The man who loved me more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a considerable trap of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be their story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for the list of <unk> list of <unk> by Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I'm about 20 years married to my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all races, all races, all races, all of their income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> relationships -- and in a long duration or said in the families, the last place we want or we would expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who was <unk> and I actually was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women of between 16 and 24 years are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls who are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, <unk> night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in the New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a college <unk> <unk> and he was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what impressed me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things he did in the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partners.
He did it all over the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me, which was so list, that I had gone to Harvard, that I would get a passion to help teenagers, teenagers, and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
He believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the arts degree in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I'm going to go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I got my job and <unk> and I went together of Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering head in a head of physical <unk> and psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where those guns.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you're supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so sure it was a lot of guns.
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one is kept under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in your pocket.
And he said he needed those guns to cause the trauma that they lived in a small basis.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and although I never had lifted my hand, my life was already serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack in <unk> was five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 quarters of my neck had <unk> I put the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
In spite of what had happened, I was living happy to live happily because I loved him, and he wanted to love me.
And I was very, very <unk>
It had just been very upset for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never would have to hurt me.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I would <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our head of honey. He ran out of traffic and threw a Big Mac cold into the face.
<unk> followed <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is the victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Disease Control Center that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help advise their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why did I not tell me, I could have gone at any time.
So for me this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we're the victims, we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is kill her.
Over 70 percent of domestic violence in domestic violence happen after the victim has finally launched the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to marriage, <unk> of financial resources, and the family court system for <unk> to the victim of family judicial to fight the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time with not <unk> with the man who was <unk> their mother.
And yet, we still continue asking why it's just not moving.
I was able to <unk> because of one last <unk> up that beat my denial.
I realized that the man loved <unk> would have killed me if there was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all the world -- to the police, my neighbors, my friends and my friends and family, to full strangers, and I'm here today because you all love me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as headlines as <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people this is a way to say <unk> is by <unk> as if the <unk> victims intentionally <unk> the men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also trained to learn a lesson of what happened to them and that they would save their lives and lives and happily like <unk> wives and mother, fully free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence, very typical violence.
I got married with a kind of cute and kind of cute guy and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to have never more, is a gun that was charged with my head in the hands of someone who says he wants me.
Right now, just like you're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people who are listening to me right now that are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they're <unk> themselves.
The abuse might be affecting his daughter, her daughter, her best friend right now.
I was able to end up to my <unk> particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
abuse is just based on silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence, just throwing light on it.
The victims need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their friends, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as a fantastic people who have a <unk> future.
We put out the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show them a safe <unk>
Together, we can convert our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> safe and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point there is a very uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed in this room like this.  Luckily, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women were stuck in, they don't have to do it now, but I find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. These are less <unk> less than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is going through this sweater by the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so I don't do anything as the head covers me.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I have completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would take the back of the back and put it out of the child's hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for the work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, which is that even though they look and <unk> it has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave it means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model now.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk>
The first question is, how are it going to be model?
I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean nothing.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape -- and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage heritage. I have known to take money to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing themselves <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> in the fashion that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> of knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York said every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> is to say, less than four percent, less than four percent.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when you <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But then, what I would tell each of these girls is, why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon -- <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this list, spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> American magazine or the next Steven <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model it's like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's outside of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have your studies, and you have a resume and you have some work on your back, no matter what you do, you know, you want to be president of the United States of the United States, but your resume would be <unk> Model of underwear for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people are always doing me is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was born, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have even my period.
I know we're getting into the personal ground, but it was a little girl.
I was looking at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
So here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the pictures for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in the winter magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a group of professionals, which was <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people of <unk> and <unk> and getting to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asking me is, well, things for free?
I have too many <unk> <unk> and I never use, except the couple of before, but the privileges I get in the real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take some money, and they gave me the free dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and <unk> and of course, we were <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to continue <unk>
I think of all of these privileges <unk> so we look for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their matter regardless of who they are.
I live in New York, and last year of <unk> teenagers who were couple of them and 86 percent were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black people in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times would I tell me, and they <unk>
When I research for this talk, I learned that 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure rises to the 78 percent of the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair -- you'll feel happy and happy hair.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we have it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative and clever people and <unk>
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs, and the brightest hair will be happier?
They just have to meet up with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs, the brightest hair and the laundry <unk> but they're probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a condition of racial gender and gender and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that we retain from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable with recognizing the power of the image in the perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was bigger enough to hold a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't get the <unk>
There were no <unk> <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum minimum in lighting.
In fact, most of them took random tourists in fact.
My story starts when I was <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife got me this picture holding my daughter on her first birthday. That's the corner of the 57 and the 5.
And it happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When my daughter, third birthday approached me, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
Here's when we started asking tourists that they were going to do that picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, never nobody has <unk> with the camera.
At the time, we were not aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping the time in October week and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, if we always get the same photo, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see the life through their eyes and how it perceives and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
Just recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when suddenly it was stopped in the tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the grocery store, which took away from small <unk>
And I was described to me that I had felt at five years in that same place.
They assumed that he remembered their heart <unk> to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he looks at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the memory of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I won't go out in many family pictures.
I am always the one that takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you didn't get to get to someone and ask somebody to get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter <unk> as a stupid black characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that I associate with <unk> Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't remain clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far away from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of New World who are mostly in the <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the Old World Bank, where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 -- facing a high risk of extinction.
So why are they important? First of all, they provide vital ecological services.
They're our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help killing all bacteria and they help absorb the anthrax than they were not for them to spread and caused huge losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers are taking three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have an historic importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the license and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and in Egypt.
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open sky -- in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities <unk> they use this poison against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical critical list of extinction, that means that in less than 10 or 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey from livestock that have been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for vet in India and have taken a posture.
Since there's no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs on the <unk> landfills and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge <unk> of time <unk> the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up the top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible trading of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're doing these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a sustainable problem is not going to serve at all.
We have to work with governments at the end of the level.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can be <unk> to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures. <unk> their time to spread the word.
When you go out of this room, you will report on the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed because he saw it because he saw them without effort, no effort in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but anymore.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead, everything we played out of it.
Our first project, which I inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where we just decided to teach people how to thrive to grow food.
So we got to seed <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach local local growing tomatoes and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so what they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they wouldn't be <unk>  We were amazed by the local local countries, as fertile valley, they didn't have agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that we were not <unk> anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  We will take time to save people from Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow into this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look at how easy the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it? You never get <unk>
I thought only that we were Italians who were failing errors in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, they did, what the English did, and then seeing what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
I would see the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that we gave people to <unk> people from Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, the Western donors -- we have delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
They just read his book.
<unk> of an African woman, the harm we've done.
<unk> are <unk> missionaries and we treat people just from two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I'm trying to do any of a different culture like my kids, I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face, tiny, small is <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman that opened this conference put a pole on the floor and said, "We can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to see the 27 years just answering people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of local people who have sleep to become a better person.
So what does you? Are you <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We sat down in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, once instead of getting into a community to tell people what to do, why not -- for a time, they will tell you, but not in <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you at a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So planning has this blind thing.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't take your public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new job.
The profession is the family member of the company, the family family physician who sets up with you in your house, at the kitchen table, in your kitchen table, and that helps him find the resources to transform his passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia in Africa.
I was making a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this junk garbage -- that we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And I was <unk>   So the government says, <unk> <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor in philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says is actually incompatible with a society and an <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of death of the <unk> of business.
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talking with you.
You have to offer your privacy, privacy, you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you come back in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you talk about here is this tomorrow?
People who are <unk> That's what you've <unk>
So, what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the world's first industrial revolution -- fossils are not renewables, and a moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we call <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution -- <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It'll be the entrepreneurs and they are doing it now.
There's an extraordinary story that I read in a magazine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> got together this group of people. And <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> whether the population keeps growing up to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure was produced by six million horses, and the manure was made impossible to address.
They were already stuck in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty little technology that would bring life in New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up <unk> companies, <unk> mining companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
So I was <unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to offer you one absolute -- dedicated <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be able to do three things: <unk> the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell with a terrific financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met one human being in the world that can be done, selling and search for the money.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We have done and looked at the 100 companies of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford -- all new companies -- Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: No one was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk>
He wasn't only when he started.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small businesses in <unk> with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> somebody who asked you, what to take?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do this."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't know a lot of knowledge even though of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects arose from questions like, how much do you pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New York <unk>
My soul always finds relief with giant <unk> which are <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust them in a city.
It always gives you the music.  There's a <unk> in New York   The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most abandoned property of the U.S.
I live close to this house and thought how it could turn it into a more pleasant space for the neighborhood and also changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was suddenly sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death then.
And this was a profound gratitude for the time that was living.
He gave them clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But let's try to keep this in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be catching by day to day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turned the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and he painted it on her phrases for <unk> Before they die <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and he was still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be trial by <unk>  Before I died, I want to sit in the line of <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died, I want to be again <unk> once more."
Before I died, I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely <unk>
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> It's about to address the reflection and the <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of messages from people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the center of the civic center we made a kit, and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, and there have Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give ourselves an opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is the time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions in our age, it is more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
The death is something we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that I was going to be prepared for death is one of those things that will become more power.
And you think about death in death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can actually reflect what matters as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please, don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, and it's very <unk>
Not speak, but it transmits joy better than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love is.
<unk> <unk> happen to happen.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and note about this: it's never <unk>
When I sing songs of our childhood, trying to say, <unk> the words that I don't even know -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
Do you get the most <unk> memory.
But it's a selective memory though.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when I was every single man of my iPod, conversations that we had when I was four years old, I got to, in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
You don't find <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't tweak the concept of normal society, they are often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although they wouldn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: that they were <unk> and <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to the physical skills.
Every single individual manifests itself in a different way, from there being so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster increases in the world, there is no cause and any known cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new person to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and actually didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I would find pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the car cars around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that was <unk>
As it was growing up more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the hyperactivity <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without prejudice, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, times when I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that I've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they are things that I wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> goes through the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> a single thing to <unk> and Sam and you know, you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside it, and honestly, the pursuit of normal, is the ultimate sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be so on.
Please, don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what must have been <unk> in the middle of the <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a communications teacher, which gave one research to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> of real students with their great minds, their big books and their great words and unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when they fell down the hole of the rabbit and saw the door to a new world.
I just felt when I had these conversations with students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenge, from energy to the health and care of health, among others, and if we don't know how to understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists and not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please go through <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that his science is sexy and their engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us that we study the <unk> but you study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when they're describing their science <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, as Einstein said everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without compromise the ideas.
One thing to consider is using examples, stories and analogies are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when you present her work, forget about the signs of <unk>
They have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> and kill them, kill them and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's too supported in the area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the only <unk> Tower.
The trick here is to use a simple sentence -- that the public can understand if you lost a little bit, and then provide graphs that would lead to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are <unk>
I think these are just a few key ones that can help the other open and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
It just sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor <unk> from the 19th century, which defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he's looking for a public charge -- no matter and <unk> or principle, which when he wins, he gets it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means to be <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all the politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It was not <unk> for example, that Parliament British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the very unusual name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They signed up in the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end, he had such popular support in London that won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most of them think it's literal <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They got all kinds of suggestions that they might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it a <unk> state of <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about quality. quality.
And not even with that were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed order.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired and tired of them, because this debate would fit in for three weeks.
And I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the failure and <unk> it was that the House of Representatives were against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to fall out of power.
They didn't want to call it King by whether he gave him to him or his <unk> ideas.
So, they wanted to give the title <unk> more <unk> and more <unk> that we came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. There was already before, but it just meant <unk> that I would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was a <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "Well we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign and meet <unk> <unk>
"And who will I take in serious with a kind of ridiculous title and insignificant as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate <unk>
We can learn three interesting things from all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, and this is my favorite to where I have been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
The President Barack Obama is lucky to go there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we move to <unk> for years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important, and this is that the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
But especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to pass the largest economy in the world and a fleet of <unk> air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
It was the title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel <unk> when you tell them that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to tell you about.
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really fundamentally changes the words than what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 meters below a land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones had <unk> tools.
Like others, I carry a cheap light on light -- he holds my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in that hole that falls hundreds of meters on the ground.
He <unk> my hand, and I suddenly remember a <unk> I met days that he lost control and dropped countless meters in that well.
As I talk with you today, these men are in the depths of that hole and their lives without paying a reward and, often, they dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they may never do it, because they're <unk> of slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the <unk> Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not about the grade.
When we end up talking to me, I was really sad, I honestly was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how much people don't know?
He got me up the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A little bit of a little bit of a little second home.
But this time, we will get the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that there are currently over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much African African number displaced throughout the entire transatlantic slave speech.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars today.
However, today can be enslaving entire families by generations by anonymous debts for 18 18.
Surprisingly, slavery generates revenues from over <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, low violence and they can't escape.
The slavery today operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
The slavery exists in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal for all the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick walls.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, children, in fact, families -- all <unk> in a heavy <unk> of <unk> packaged in their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from the blast <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
<unk> by <unk> and tiredness works in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee -- no coffee to drink, and the severe <unk> made it just pee was pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and the way it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run into the car to clean the team and make it work there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back on the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't <unk> you don't get it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizenship from that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on the <unk> and the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and he complained that he <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart attack.
In the Himalayas I found children carrying rocks in a mile per mile down to trucks to <unk>
Those big <unk> were stronger than the children who charge them and children <unk> their heads on their heads, and they made <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been the whole life.
You have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely raised their houses.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual traffic and because of this global awareness to me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk>
It led me for a few stairs <unk> which gave this faint <unk> of faint <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more like a restaurant.
<unk> as this is known as being known as they're <unk>
They have small rooms, they have private rooms, where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- are posed to <unk> and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and dangerous, identified by one number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their customers.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I only had a little bit of a <unk> the stairs where I was going.
There was no <unk>
There were no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult issue -- it's important to point out that slavery even even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, in the <unk> service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of play.
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
The black black hands are from the father, the blue <unk> of blue and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, being able to get out of this house one day and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It is estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake we found the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two older brothers -- some older brothers, some younger brothers, some more young children, makes sense right?
<unk> They were all <unk>
Children are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced them to work <unk> long on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me there was a topic that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of the trees <unk> in Lake <unk> often <unk> networks and children, <unk> and with fear, it gets to water to unleash the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of her love he's not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were searching for the last networks, but they had been working from one another.
It's on the cold and <unk>
And it would point out that these networks are weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter in which they <unk> the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
He ran out of a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his motorcycle <unk> and <unk> our car and touched the window.
We were asked to do it by a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we would get out of the car and asked the driver that went out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the road, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that I would go down the road and after walking around a time we found that the path was going to be caught by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures about my head as you go into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up in a while, and we had a mass of holes in front of a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children attached to their back, and as they were looking for gold gold, they were <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a pump in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> given that many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have to be 90 feet -- and these people have carry <unk> heavy stone bags that will then be shipped out to another area where they were <unk> the stone to get the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the margin we see another lucky ones and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When her father died he took him to work with him in mines.
When you die his uncle, they <unk> I understood the debt of the uncle to be slave in mines.
When I met him, he had worked in <unk> 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so much that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet to that, he's forced to work night and day in that mine.
And yet, he dream to be liberated and educated with help from local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of a direction, which makes me much respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted to know that we would give witness to them and to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to <unk> atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> they're people, and people like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think of these so many beautiful people, I think I've had the great honor to know.
And I hope these images are getting a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that the force turns on a fire and that fire would make light on a fire, because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do this applied math and there is a particular problem for who the <unk> are like management <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I will try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> dancers --  that we'll see later.
But <unk> demand for a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> <unk> that you can have a genetic component of it.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease like Parkinson's of Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous ballet dancer <unk>
Over the last few years has been made a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an antiangiogenic weakness <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need to use it to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we know if there really exists a cure when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not all markers -- so they don't have the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic. It's very, very expensive, and that means out of the clinical trials, it's never been done.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test ourselves?
It doesn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do is that I want to think about it as a conventional <unk> to a try, you see, in some sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the Golden cords <unk>
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds -- we can imagine as a dancers of a vocal <unk> because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed <unk> for example.
And like <unk> requires an extraordinary training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learning to speak.
So from sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as you go back, and like that kind of Parkinson's disease is also affecting the <unk>
On the bottom line you can see an example of <unk> elastic ropes ...
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical clinical trials -- well, both of them are <unk>
<unk> is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> Well, but in addition to <unk> tests.
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
It's minimal cost, and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes so much <unk> it appears at massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce the humanitarian difficulties of patients.
You wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the <unk> of routine.
With high monitoring we could get objective data.
We could do massive amounts of under cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a big scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Parkinson's disease Initiative today.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no Parkinson's or no disease, I can call it under price and leaving recordings for the cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we have reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So I <unk> taking all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What about these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease, TR: Yeah.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> You may not hear it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking at <unk> the confusion of confusion in search of real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a sense of accuracy at this moment?
It's more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to have a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what we did is the project -- now we have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I did <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We are <unk> in the darkness, in rooms, with no windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do that thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin, even more <unk> we do the impossible possible -- we do the impossible and we have some of us in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with lots of years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where I was <unk> there <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't sit at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May <unk> I traveled to <unk>
It's a small village of <unk> located in <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first peoples affected by the wave.
The water level of the recorded water reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles into the inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
We bring out the rubble of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools removed the sludge and leave the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish -- dead fish -- dead <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, as many volunteers as the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of pictures and cameras and <unk>
They all did the same thing.
They go back and take them to different places of villages around the villages around them.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they came out of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of village <unk>
It helped clean up the Olympic bathrooms -- giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the <unk> center will pick up the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor of that day to go back to me to clean up the photos.
And this was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression thought beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until far as far as my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the photos, I found some that had over a hundred years ago, some of them were still in the back of the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had collapsed, the face of the girl had to get to have to have to have a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the step of the time, they got more of the pictures and got more <unk> so it came back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later -- 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people who were trying to <unk>
In Japan, in Japan -- we were <unk> to <unk> a village to north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of the time that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we were in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
She could have an hour. I could have a couple of weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw in pretty much hand using a guide the areas that color and detail the water was not <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures long as in seawater, covered in bacteria, with algae covered with algae -- even with algae -- all over the time with the step of time I continue <unk> that was a big part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was clean clean and dry and <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We count on the guidance of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more photos as well.
As he said once <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
I had started <unk> it itself but stopped when he realized that we would get them even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband was not <unk> we were able to put the images in a single photo and they would take the entire picture.
When you picked up their pictures shared something of his story with us.
A fellow of her husband found the pictures on a fire station between the rubble of the rubble far away from where he used to be their house, but his colleagues were <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to shut the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
His little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took her a week to find her family and knowing that everyone had survived.
The day I gave her pictures his little son was <unk>
To her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could get to do, something that he could remember from the past that would not have been labeled by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up more than 135,000 photographs -- the big <unk> -- the big majority came in the hands of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds of pictures totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend over 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one thing, someone loved it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take but the first thing that we would get to look for.
But this was what the project was trying to restore small pieces of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this will give someone, it was a huge difference in the life of the person who gets it.
This project made a huge difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected up to something bigger and to bring something, using their talents to something that is not a thin skin.
To finish my email I would like to read this electronic email -- I sent it Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I did that, I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular picture -- a picture with women in various ages to the small child, gathering around a baby, gathering about a baby, <unk> because a very similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my daughter <unk> hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few times our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> I was inspired by wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that cuts through an apple in an exhibition in a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go to a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can make videos in a slow motion of light into motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and go on it and go on it and put it on a <unk> <unk> in a number of <unk> to create a photo package.
And that series of photons, <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
If we take that bullet and this series of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do they disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the light aspect of the light in the <unk>
Now, this --  Remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower than you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a series of photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes off the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a <unk> bubble in the inside.
At that time, the waves go down the table, and because of the insights, of the top part of the bottle, after several boxes, the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit to see that film?
A week? A week? In fact, every year.
It would be a very boring film, of a slow bullet of a movement.
And what about the beginning of nature <unk>
You can see the waves off the table, the tomato wall and the wall in the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes can see a different <unk>
But if you look at one more time you look at this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside it and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check whether the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera in the <unk>
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture to the <unk> it comes in very little light.
But it's going to go a billion times faster than the shortest one, so you just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data on raw and <unk> data.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a marketplace would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the front door, you're going to go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light points.
It's not science fiction. We have built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in moments slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capacity.
It has very good time resolution and can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door, and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what point it corresponds to what a distance.
When you project a laser projecting a picture of <unk> you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we pull this out in the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that make collisions with what's going on the curve, to the curve, OK.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected in open windows by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> you can actually see the inside of the body having a <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of tissue and blood is quite difficult, so this is actually an order for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new mode of visualization to solving the problems of environmental imaging in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, he became science in art, an art of photographs in the <unk>
I realized that all of the <unk> of data we collected every time is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
We'll create a new form of computer photography with slow and color code.
And let's look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's a funny thing here.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you leave us on us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have a strange effects, Einstein would have happy to see this image.
The order that the events occur in the world are sometimes shown in front of the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can hold your life, and you give you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, you can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and you can get it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and living in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to be looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that they were looking for a change in your pocket.
Who are a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Blackberry, a Blackberry, <unk>
It's a lot of all today have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me, from my mobile, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
empirical data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single Internet vendor in all Europe, has to store a wide range of information from the users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends him a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, on your phone company, or your Internet provider or your Internet.
And in all of Europe, people were planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers all over us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people that came out to the streets in Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police, of East Germany, <unk>
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> who in that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please give me all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I didn't get to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah, blah,
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a lawsuit for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, they <unk> an agreement.
It will take the demand and they send me the information that I would get.
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD inside.
And there was this.
Thirty thousand dollars and five thousand of information.
I saw them and I said, well, it's an enormous file. Okay.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
Was it a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and you can go back and go forward.
You can see every step I want to see.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls the other, and the other one, and we ended up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate it communicates to what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leader leaders.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who speaks to who, who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, you had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who they were the leaders, this would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would never have happened.
And as a result, neither is the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to be <unk>
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come home home to your friends that privacy is a 21st century value, and it's not fashionable in fashion.
When you go home, you go back to his representative -- that just because business agencies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to.
And if you don't believe me, ask your company, what information store you about you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that goes to you to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different addresses in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why I get all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> nor can it <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were siblings, but they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any one in the room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
We go for a ride.
Christmas Day, Christmas, you're in the shopping mall, drive in circles looking for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little <unk>
Moreover, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There will be a <unk> of the <unk> I earn the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If that doesn't feel better, maybe they should be done.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same early ones.
I also love that if I want to walk from my house to New York, I would do.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you try and do it <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents would go to the school system and get rid of the school too, and if we didn't take all the top note, they all got the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk five years putting my <unk> on their feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that I did it.
The <unk> I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten was walking as a <unk> champion that has received many <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they continue to be every family.  I think nobody realized that we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> like <unk>
The people that I grew up with no problem with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of me who died of hunger during the <unk>
I was telling them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so they <unk> at dawn to sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I am too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if not to go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were <unk> in <unk>
On the summer vacation I often tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> I was wearing hot cups on the back, and I would go back into the South Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I thought <unk> <unk>
But the silver cure was the yoga.
I should say that it's very boring, but before I do yoga I was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can <unk> in the head.
My parents would come up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital was <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant for the <unk> University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater department.
All of you.
I did all the least <unk> I took off the ultimate note in my classes -- and also on their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow through Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with brain <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "When I finally have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of it, we finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the role.
I went to <unk> running the head of the theater, crying up, historically, as if someone would have killed my cat, asking me why and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that was literally born and gave him to an actor without cerebral <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I went back home, I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was like extra on a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> directors not <unk> actors -- not white, white, disability.
We only get perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I became <unk>
On my first tour, I took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when she fell into the account of the <unk> New Jersey <unk> with a driver who had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little bit unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and the means of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
It was much easier for Arabs to fight the challenge of the stigma <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program on the cable with Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduate dance dance, I went back to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the CEO and I said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the computer desk to not go off the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they would not get having me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I stayed in the full time participant and hit my chair.
Something kind of fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me and a girl who was not older.
All of a sudden, my online disability became <unk> <unk>
Take some comments online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite, a terrorist.
What does it have?
We really should pray for her."
A <unk> suggested I even suggested my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The disability is as visual as race.
If somebody in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in a wheelchair.
The disabled are the one. Yeah, man. man.
The disabled are the biggest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
And yet, having grown with media media, I don't think we could.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that's less <unk> on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we even need the whole society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I arrived at <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of the soap Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world -- Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in the <unk> state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give children Syrian refugee children, a little bit of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me act live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives the small town to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything to him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunity, no job, no future future.
He ends up in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year I was doing anything.
One day is a guy who offers him to take him to dinner, then for dinner, <unk>
It sends a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes to send home your family.
They presented to a young lady.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts down a bomb.
That little boy of that small village with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a connected terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how does the story of a small village to try to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that he pulled it out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban urban <unk> who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> in London, who are looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffer from the highest unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terrorism, the <unk> to the violence -- will be the story of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit St. Hospital -- the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, "Well, if I had never gone?
And if I'd seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few juvenile leaders at a business scene.
They went to a few 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because it was a graduate college college, I was frustrated, perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have destroyed completely the road system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> drawn to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds to <unk> over the next three years.
Why is it different this story?
What does this story do?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the entrepreneurial spirit and I think that entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are searching so often.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was trained to train some of the young people at the summit of the corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of corporate initiative.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years ago, and until I had Mohamed came, if you wanted to put flowers for your <unk> we were from plastic sent from the <unk>
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of you who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design company.
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in houses, and the city companies -- and now he's working on creating the world's first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where families can go together, and, like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, to work for the government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that they might be businesspeople, in the change.
To the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They provide business solutions for local problems.
So then, to inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas true.
They need expertise and guidance for them in the development and set out of their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources that they need, and they need the support that they need to move from conception to the creation, and create real estate for urban growth.
To me, entrepreneurship is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think he's selling hope.
Their Peace Park is how it calls it when he is created, transforming the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape <unk> <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I had about ten years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> <unk> area north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
<unk> forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not being on the way that we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on on the ground.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square meters with <unk> <unk> balls and <unk> balls.
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and he would get a little bit apart.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how a <unk> or where you get -- the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the clean <unk> Department of <unk> and over 11 tons of waste and two tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through her pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed more to go.
So I started working as a trash yard.
Now I wouldn't just travel in the trucks. I don't know them.
And they operated the mechanical mechanical and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and a staggering learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as you think, and in the days that it's very strong one will be <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years, and their bodies kept taking them up the weight of their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> We <unk> waste is one of the 10 most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You are coming out and go into traffic all day and go <unk> around you.
They just want to <unk> so that the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And then the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and have terrible damage damage.
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always must be in motion.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I believe strongly that <unk> waste is the most important work hand on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste and effective form every day, this starts to take away from their containers and its dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
We have been controlled by decades, and centuries and centuries come back and start <unk>
The economy needs the needs.
If we can't get rid of the old stuff, we don't have room for how new engines are starting to fail when it's endangered consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointed out the relationship.
And then there is what I call our average average speed required.
This is just the speed of the speed that we used to move in the time contemporary time.
We don't usually hurt ourselves or <unk> or we have our cup of coffee, our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a force force on the other side that it takes to it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are on the street every day, in a <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that they keep us with us with us from ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow will always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection truck on the street, grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that, I began to investigate waste collection and went back to that man.
It's called <unk> we work together a lot of times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and having to account all the costs, even the real human cost of the labor.
The municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about <unk> represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing to see someone whose job is to clean the crap of you, take a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects from this today.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
And after seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> of the <unk> generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, its kind of looking at Africa with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a very rich place for a rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really <unk> with the old market that is this <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy stuff every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how do you build a building building from several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in a lot of a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was we made a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs from the building.
And it spreads out with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space in the open air in the building that would spread by its own form, the sun and rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how close to the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would lead to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of a concrete <unk> <unk> to allow the air input and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of things that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the sunlight inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It was not what it was <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of market was to be much more profitable than the shopping center was to be more profitable than the commercial center of the mall because they had more local to sell.
And then the whole idea of the facade was much more social, not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because you didn't have any air <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage to putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting areas and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water for inner <unk>
So for the beginning of the next year, because we go on the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that's so large, the biggest project I have designed, it needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve <unk> doors connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the existing streets and creating 12 initial building blocks like size and features in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some set of <unk> in relation to the idea of the gates <unk> with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project -- as the apartment, as an apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So let's make a scheme that ensures that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result of a combination of the European block and the Arab city and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the <unk> we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And also responding to local standards that set up greater density at higher levels and lower density in the plant plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving out of the community space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and forth and make activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where we can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in life of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture for simple solutions, but we need to make the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had a very bright little series of very bright hair and a nice <unk> of pencils -- cute. It was super <unk> for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I brought my sinister plan.
One day I stayed a time after the school <unk> I was a little afternoon, and I was going to sit in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> I walked into the classroom, I took my teacher on my teacher <unk>
And then, I did.
I put up the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some of them.
All the same.  And I set up to bring the book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other teammates had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of rows from <unk> and myself in a row from this way, just by being there, since I was there.
I'm still surprising to what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I would never tell me.
But above all, I was going to tell you, the reason why I was bothered by this little little little little girl -- it was so good to <unk>
I was <unk> the jealousy.
They're so mysterious and <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one causes for a number of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study to analyze the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the laboratory in which we study <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's a exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> there would be neither literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There was no king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
I put up the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No <unk> no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost all of the <unk>
This year is spent 100 years of his masterpiece, "In the pursuit of time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> -- I mean, all we could have --  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think in a kid trying to <unk> sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forget about how relentless it is.
I mean, these are books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> which are reduced to the person, to their wish, their <unk> are a good narrative.
I don't know. I think we're very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being at the time, storytellers and audience, we know exactly what <unk> details to <unk> the <unk> right?
The <unk> make all novelists <unk> and that's something that I was trying to understand.
All that she makes me to give me pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that <unk> detects in his lover, he adds him to his collection of instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion of emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
The <unk> use the details.
They like the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and cute little <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links to the language of jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of <unk> in soon listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with true value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're looking for knowledge, looking at the truth, a painful truth, in fact, to <unk> <unk> the more painful -- the best better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to do, that makes us suffer, causes us to a whole range of feelings of much more profound and vital that a wise man who can make us <unk>
It's telling us let's go for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion of emotion, our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about it later.
One day, Freud had been visited by a very <unk> young woman who was being used to the idea that his woman would get it.
And Freud says there was something weird in that man, which is not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, without realizing it."
<unk> <unk> or was accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
<unk> described very well how the <unk> are going to look at intensity but without accuracy.
In fact, the most intensely <unk> we are, we are, we are more than we have the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead to violent actions or illegal acts of it.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for eight years old, I'm sorry, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan of 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake Facebook account from the one that was sending horrible <unk> to himself, for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to <unk> the whole of his former girlfriend of her former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
What's huge -- although <unk> <unk> Right?
It's like <unk>
Like from a Patricia Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books who try to love our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take his <unk> character.
Tom <unk> it's going to be <unk> or want what you have to do is you get to <unk> you know what you've ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- <unk> to your name, and it takes your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, both like I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where a coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of <unk> <unk> at Professor <unk> that criminal genius think.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head face of rat <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but it was <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But how do they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once that <unk> inside, we walked back to all of his solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to give me your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> was transferred in history. It seems to me this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> like a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can do it with her.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as long as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Just fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> freshwater <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
And the 21 of July 1, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the National <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Beaufort Sea, the <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the surface of the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the greatest mobilization in peace times in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked for 20,000 businesses, universities and community agencies.
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on its surface, of which lives after the death of Armstrong last year, is the most <unk>
So why are you <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because Kennedy Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice University -- they give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why will it scale the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why would you fly about <unk>
Why does it play Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West about the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology's technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, <unk> <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 -- called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle <unk> but in 1969, the <unk> crew flew at 40,000 miles -- / hour.
Since the 1970s, no human being back to the moon.
No one has traveled the faster that the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism optimism about the power of technology has evaporated to see that problems that we imagine that technology would solve the way to go to Mars, create clean energy, cure cancer, or to feed the world's population seem to have a result.
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> escape.
I knew that this would be the last mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that is, of relying on our ability to solve problems with <unk> it has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have found themselves and had enriched up with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed out the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But they don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation for <unk> in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> and <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists offer for entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of ideas <unk> by the funding of problems and even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about risk, they preferred small investment investment than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with benefit in technologies as energy, which need tremendous capital and whose development is in the long run, they haven't invested in developing technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have commercial value immediately.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you go to it.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption, from renewable energy from renewables like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative sources that can compete at price -- don't exist.
Now, technologists, businessmen, and economists agree about what policy and international treaties -- the development of an effective energy -- increase a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the carbon price.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, they're not to be.
We know from the time that famines are a result of failure in the food <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like we harvest it, or the systems for storage and the <unk> of food, but there will be famines as there were bad governments.
Finally, big issues sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the cancer war in 1971, we were soon discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant cancer to treatment, and only in the last 10 years they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and <unk> but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, and the institutions must want to support the problem, because it is really a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, does this <unk>
But it's a model that we have in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like <unk> the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we're not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a very large decline of trust, is a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why are people thinking that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me turn me to think that there can be reduced in some activities or institutions that might have risen on others.
I don't know.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that the trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's not a lot of evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they continue to be quite <unk> the usual nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But is this evidence enough?
What traditional opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you look at is the generic attitudes that are all the people when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody will tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at <unk> teachers.
I would probably get to ask, "What for?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but some other no."
What's very rational.
In short, in real life, we tend to <unk> trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we are going to feel for a certain kind of official official or a person -- it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain grade teacher that I know to give you the reading class but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop all that knowledge when we think about trust in the more <unk>
I think these surveys are really bad tools to measure the real level of real, because they try to deal with the good inherent judgment by relying on something or somebody.
Secondly, what happens to the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not the goal that I would <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is afraid of trust, but not what it isn't.
In short, I'm a <unk> of not trust in what's not reliable.
And I think those people who were taking their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
They were deposited or <unk> <unk> that's the right target.
And once you say it says, yes, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not the trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But yeah, on the contrary, they're not responsible for them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure you can do certain things, but I see that I would take your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If you are, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're <unk> to have before we trust.
Trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we have tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of professional institutions, officials and others, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, wow, the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that going to be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all our public life, and we found that the system of accountability that is destined to ensure the <unk> and testing them actually is doing the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
All you know is similar examples.
We put all of that, in the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we are worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that we're safe and if we try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- the <unk> that don't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task -- rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people together, trying to improve the trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's defining because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford to all over the time, all the people all the time.
But you also have to bring serious evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That gets every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks <unk> says I can return them without giving <unk>
I take them and return the money, or you change it for the color that I want.
That's cool. I rely on them because they were very vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other side, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing at is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is the relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone <unk> increasingly and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started to imagine what it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that would be used in digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the arms transfers their physical body at the pixel at the pixel at the pixel at the pixel at the pixel at the pixel in the other.
And designers can put their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool they break down the barriers.
But the two hands still remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole <unk>
In the Science of Sciences <unk> of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
It turns out a transparent cap with deep cameras to detect their fingers and face, and now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels right with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and set out lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down on every floating screen.
Architects can spread or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we type in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information to come towards us?
<unk> a lot of us will have bought and present things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
So what I've got here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted in your head or <unk> when the system does understand the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, rather than just seeing pixels in space, how we can make physical physicists so that we can get <unk> and <unk>
How would a future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this only physical pixel here.
This magnet magnet, is behaving as a pixel in 3D, in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> and <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And when we programming the object, we released it from the restrictions of the time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and they will reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> physically and distance and the famous shot from Michael Jordan, can be reproduce as a physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets like this: physics, and, unlike the monitors or the text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than to change the computer part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us without having to get us from our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believed firmly that there was just an accurate path to <unk> a safe and <unk> work.
No matter whether the work would be like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer age.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must begin to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to an opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult told you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends are <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much bigger to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class was all the only thing you might aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> OK.
<unk> to books.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> de Nan <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were eradicated in China, of course.
"The <unk> <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not a <unk> convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and <unk>
<unk> I told myself, "It is so different, and much better than you get.
So it became my tool for me to get out of this <unk> trap, and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find this with a new culture also led to my biological reading habit.
We get a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me that it seemed to be out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never happened, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's research fields like comparative religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
It can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> David <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> <unk> are economic and politics and <unk>
By Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
["The <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of lost in the translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feeling alone or <unk>
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, of where the dreams comes from, where the passion comes from.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client in <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
And Alex came into the first session using jeans and a <unk> encountered on the couch and I took away my shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a client.
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it became easy just to move the head while they were making the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> I would say Alex, and so I was looking at it was right.
You start to work after that, then you have children later, you have children later, to death later.
By <unk> like Alex and I had a long time.
But shortly after, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his <unk> life.
I was <unk>
I said, "Yeah, he's coming out with guys under his category, it would be <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not as if it were to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "No no, but maybe you get <unk> on the next one.
In addition, the best time to work in marriage of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in its development.
This made the <unk> of Alex was the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences not only for Alex and his loving life but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> all over the place.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one gets to age age without passing before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take the dream -- a <unk> I want to see. That's okay. Wow.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will become 35 years old.
That means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments -- that give your life to have happened to you when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> I couldn't <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last phase of growth in its <unk> and it is <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change from themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other moment in life and we know that the female fertility goes to its top to 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the developing child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday everyday life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't listen to is often something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the line of time <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> <unk> names to the <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely anything.
And then every day, you know, smart, interesting people like you or your children come up to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship won't notice. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while you're going to start a career before 30, everything will be good."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better dancer day that I graduated from college.
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some time about the 30, the music turned out, and they all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I was <unk>
Where are the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but they don't get rid of the stakes are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure to the ages of 30, and so many of them will start a career, pick a mate, and you have two or three children in a long period of time much shorter time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there is research that you start to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything of the <unk>
The average age crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
You know that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother your child.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and I sat in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was in his own words, having a identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living very hard <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
It was often <unk> in our <unk> but then she gets up with the saying, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day, he got his head on his head, and he cried during almost every hour.
He had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after words -- <unk> <unk> please call <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if it gives me <unk>
At that point, it cost me a lot of work to resist and I didn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which is actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as I was just sitting in the next decade of Emma going.
So, over the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> identity.
For identity capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates capital of identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try to.
I'm not <unk> exploration exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that should not count -- which, by the way, is not <unk>
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and make it tell.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with the similar minds in terms of who you know, what they know about, how they think about, how do they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes from the outside of its nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak bonds of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak ties are the way we manage this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a really published job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> his family when you have a couple and form his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think 30 is better age to sit than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live in now or have been <unk> now when all on Facebook start to walk towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or killing time with anyone who would join you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate to the roommate I was working in a art museum in the other state.
This weak bond helped her get a work there.
That work supply gave a reason to leave the boyfriend to alive.
Now, five years later, it's special <unk> events in museums.
This married one man who chose <unk>
I would have his new career, love her new family, her new family, and I send a letter that said, "Now the spaces of contacts are not enough <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like airplanes coming out of the airport from Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the West <unk>
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good break, a good deal of TED can have huge effects on the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk> who heard of.
It's as simple as I learned to tell <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> <unk> get identity capital, you get your identity capital, you get your <unk> you choose your family.
They don't even define what they didn't know or whatever.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in consulting for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach students at <unk> <unk> in public schools in New York.
And as any teacher, providing tests and test.
I gave them tasks.
When I work back, I would save grades.
What I called the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and worst students.
Some of them who had a better performance had no idea <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was really convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure our best way to measure.
But what if you're successful in school and in life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn in a quick and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> would be <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict how much children we were going to get away from the competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in neighborhoods, really hard neighborhoods, and what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking yourself, which of these marketers are going to keep their job work?
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a feature as a very important success of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, health and not <unk>
It was purpose.
<unk> passion and perseverance to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for a week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all speed.
A few years ago, I began to study determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who made my questionnaires of determination and then I waited about more than a year to see who they were <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly higher than graduation, even when we were involved in each trait that I could measure, things like family income, the results of testing testing, even security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> in which purpose. It's also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about purpose is the little thing that we know, how little science knows about development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid job ethic.
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who simply don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, acute determination is not related or even related to the measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I heard about developing determination in children is something called <unk> of growth."
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they are much more prone to <unk> when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mentality is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to fail, to begin everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories -- is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the Chinese media.
Since that time, I was obsessed with this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do that.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes from every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than let's do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signs of traffic traffic menus to understand the basic idea of the Web or the newspapers.
Today I would start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides -- like I was shouting <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> -- this symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it's the other way. The one that makes you work.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
the moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of <unk> doors in the old West.
So I call radical to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If anybody walks back, that's <unk>
Like the old saying, two are a company, three are crowd.
If one person drives their arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
Is it a count as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a <unk> two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
You put a chart under the tree, we have the foundations of the ground.
Put a mouth on the tree, that is a <unk>  <unk> to remember, as a tree. It's quite an idiot.
Do you remember the fire?
Two shapes together, it gets too hot.
Three sets together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk> together.
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door, putting a board inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> had someone at home?
This person is walking out on a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're careful <unk>
So we've already gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every small effort you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters -- which is the same as a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the earth of the <unk> sun.
This is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun along the origin, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked on the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become <unk>
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is an output.
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the films I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz magician together.
The movie was his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raised our children in a kind of complex industrial fantasy show.
But the Oz magician was a event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> -- a metal boy and a <unk> boy <unk> a girl dressed like guard of the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there is a couple of great differences between the magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician would do it today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling prophecy.
You use magic shoes to defeat the <unk> created by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the other thing about the magician magician is that the most important characters and wise characters are women.
I started noticing this when I did Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At the time, I also had a son at that time.
Three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the surveillance level had <unk>  And so slid in the room and became impressed as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be themes of value, perseverance and <unk>
So I would feel that you have a sense that Luke get one military to overthrowing the government?
So let's put this with the magician of Oz in <unk>
How does it make Dorothy the film?
We do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow to you -- OK? And not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so many capital F, force in movies for our children, and so little of the way of the bricks of bricks in it.
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know for experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss. I was expected to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why do you stay there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on <unk> <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a bad animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and I stand to <unk> Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they guys, they're not really their target public.
They make a phenomenal job of teaching girls how they defend themselves against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend themselves from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all the time continues up in classic <unk> each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and her son, or two men who are raising a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, eventually came out <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a film of a <unk>
It's really good. Don't let them get it?
Well, almost none of these films is the proof of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not to be roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book illustrator and the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend about the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions you have to <unk> in the film, there's more than a female character who has lines?
So, you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else that you like it?  All right?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and they talk about things else.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk> movie.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success of <unk> a idea of consensus from what a Hollywood Hollywood film is.
<unk> is not the proof of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it -- a lot of film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the crisis of the hostage.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's start in numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 more films how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> isn't bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, then is fine.
But there is a bigger number than this one who is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, right?
In the United States, one of five women said it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but when I listen to that statistics wrong, and when I hear that statistics one of the things I think is there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story of a male hero is to defeat violence, with violence, and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to be <unk>
We have tools for our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that that will be, but I have to ask you, but I have to ask you, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we have to show our kids out a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is completely changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite <unk> character of Star Wars Do you know what <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight just and more stories where they see their work is to join a team -- maybe a team led for women, help other people better and become better people, like the <unk> magician as a <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I really liked was to look at sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They are covered in sand covered and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was going to become <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me to <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I can see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to about 1.3 miles of length along the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to using satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the infrared <unk>
This is a place located in the east Delta.
And the thing in the naked sight, seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and processing it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like <unk> <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes in the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an ancient <unk> town, called <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of two kings -- that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge -- it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved to the time and covered all the city.
So how do we find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I will try to find that random -- it's the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this very high area that you see inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots of the <unk> but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, under a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> <unk> of several hundred years that date from the Middle East, exactly the same time we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry workshop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a nearby future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire -- probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So it seems TED that was not founded in 1984 to do C.
Do I know that ideas happen really started in 1984 B.C. C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the top.
You actually put the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing out of the door to <unk> home.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is made.
Now <unk> a group of obese <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> race and they go into their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door to your house.
There's flying around everywhere, wheels that go on the side of the wheels that end up in places called <unk> the threshold of the gate,
The lobby, the hallway or whatever there is on the other side of the door, and notice the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
He's waving with your hand.
From his chair, it was a brown horse from his chair.
It's a horse that talks about.
You can feel your blue fur, you can tickle her nose.
You can smell the burglar cookie and you think it's about to get into the mouth.
They put on one side and enter your living room.
In the room, and making maximum use of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on the center of the center, singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now let me go into the kitchen.
The ground has been covered with a yellow brick road and from the oven. They come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that has been conducted in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I was going to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, waiting, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies and a few ladies and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- looking at them just once.
It monitors the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
It takes entire poems in just minutes.
So you can memorize to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best memories <unk>
And I said, <unk> when you realized when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using a half thousand years ago in Greece, a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives that the <unk> academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, "How did I not hear about this <unk>
We were standing outside of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant English guy, although a little <unk> said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live <unk>
That will prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went together in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And on return, it was a number of treated about the written memory, something over 2,000 years ago in <unk> in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having a <unk> and disciplined memory and <unk> wasn't such a thing as rare as it can be like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made us possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have shifted the culturally and I would say we have also changed our mind.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory that is this extraordinary competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there is the skills that are all around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a bunch of researchers from University College London invited a bunch of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in some way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a local test battery. And the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them into an MRI machine, it would take your brains as they are <unk> numbers, expensive numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is driving as a race race where each year, someone has a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors have to get to the day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times of memory.
On his desk, I in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits binary figures.
Over half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a huge amount of ways of remembering things in these <unk> it's absolutely all the techniques that are used at the end of the end of the end that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
This is illustrates by an elegant elegant -- known as the paradox -- <unk> <unk> he says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I tell you -- I think there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there is a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later on, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told to be told for their work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the Baker, name doesn't really mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> in their hands.
They do well when they come home from work.
You probably have a <unk>
And when I came up with that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back and a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who was attending a <unk>
They had hired as entertainment, as entertainment, because they wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring a <unk> to a poet.
He stood up -- he took her memory poem, and he was <unk> and as soon as it was, the <unk> room would <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So you couldn't get the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> <unk> every survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his mind, I could see where it had been sitting around here.
It took the family of my hand <unk> where their loved ones were among the rubble.
So what you would have to pick up in that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter if we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you let me tell you, the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet if I told you to say who was sitting on the horse and brown beat in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember. The crazy one, <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory -- the same way it would have done it -- if you had invited it to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that utterly <unk>
And then you can imagine entering his house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you of that anecdote that you want to count.
And then you walk into the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
So this is like <unk> speakers <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, which is going to confuse him but typical of typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about the <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> the first <unk> it would be like the first place in his palazzo of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got it full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and he had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring.
Really, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting in <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing happens is when someone gets off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in people's minds in these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell you this story, I needed to try and put in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before sitting to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old <unk> school bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was a lot of fun.
I would never have hoped that we would have it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What it's really about to do is better improve and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of safety covered with tape leaving just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory specialties.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could put it in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, and it's actually not the point.
These are just just silent tricks. They work.
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to be building <unk> of memory or <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> donated but not the case.
Great memories were <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply in.
The <unk> and these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It will make a kind of deep processing kind of speed that most is not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things become <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side -- we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even bother processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory abilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you have to be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we will just take a place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was about <unk> I was living there in my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time I was watching television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, I all saw it, and every time I went back and <unk> and I wrapped up in a towel that I was looking at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
<unk>
Those feelings that I felt, and that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, it's not about mathematics, and it's not in the area of areas, but of those connections that we feel emotional that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like this, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under ceiling.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice us.
That makes us a bit of naive and very, very predictable.
That means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that this is how you think that we can based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> who uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build <unk>
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people that <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that are going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he's got a <unk> it has this round thing round columns, that <unk> red -- that <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the kids, the <unk> values -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library in today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, had another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called <unk> are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side there is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions to life forms in today's life.
We were <unk> and we gave them so far away from the people.
Of course, all of the black, you think we feel really good, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We need to go to the other side and come back to these symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start to experience <unk> we do <unk> the pendulum back forward, over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really hard.
So we are approaching the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that I like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
So we took concepts <unk> and we become <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes <unk> they won on audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became the columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial malls and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic fantasies of them.
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to the French or the Italian.
You may not be able to have a pair of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreating memories of other places.
I know that this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects are frustrated and we started making <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experience with so-called <unk>
We have the symbols -- we now have new <unk> design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few forms of ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally, the beginnings of <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened.
In 1997, the building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academic and public public in general were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times <unk> <unk> this <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao raised at a half a half percent when the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these wild forms, and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these shapes, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the New York country with other star architects.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go through all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane, you can be <unk>
Technology <unk> You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we all are photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere. That means that the communications speed has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before we knew if the one I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen, because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply to the brink of communication, it starts to <unk> every time faster, until you get on both extreme extremes -- and you can actually get into the difference between innovation and symbol, in fact, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make <unk> symbols with emotional payload of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk>
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like the product finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, and that first summer, when people started getting and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you did in the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with our collective memory, and when you charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet will look for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, about innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there's no unique answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using <unk> words and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> audience, which is not accepting something that has never seen before.
architects can listen, and one doesn't leave us with the architecture.
That means that the beginnings of one style of one style of one style of movement is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick that was based on ideas of what it should be a <unk>
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that buildings are being moved to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to do sports or to <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means three architects can dream with swimming on the East Side of New York, and raising half a million dollars from the community together around that cause, no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that go to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent and more <unk>
We have been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they shape the way to the <unk> spaces, the local libraries of the homes where we form our kids, and the step of the bedroom the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it makes it that great great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look in the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this, and my mom tells me I used to do this. And so when do you stop doing this?
How is it that we suddenly are not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for say, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be liked and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, even though his mom tells you all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
Among what his mom says and what his mom or friends say, you don't know who you believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to please let me be nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received over 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a normal and ordinary teenager who receives these answers to one of the stages of their most emotionally emotionally emotionally.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, adolescents today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking to me, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We've never been as connected, we have never been so connected, in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand is <unk>
This environment, to be always connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no division between a live life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what is <unk>
What is the biggest thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> zero continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now an routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young young people are.
But boys are not immune to this.
Like the ones of the sports stars and the folk singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and they're really good individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to their appearance, at price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects start to be hurt.
Six of every 10 girls prefer to do something because they think you don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and how to taxpayers and the field of labor development.
<unk> 20 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the discussion of class. They are engaging in the debates of classroom because they don't want to call attention by their physical way.
One out of five are not <unk> at all over the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the previous season, if you don't think you see you good enough, specifically if you don't think you're fine enough -- you will take a lower note to the average of your classmates who don't care about how appearance.
And this phenomenon has silence in Finland, the U.S. and China.
And it gives independently of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be pretty clear, we are talking about how you see you not how you're like.
The low self-esteem over its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem does less less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, engage in more diet than they can take them to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this because this is why they make <unk> decisions like alcohol consumption and drugs, diets <unk> surgery aesthetics, sexual relationships at early ages and without protection and damage damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs it for billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they have no higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe in the way they see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be <unk>
It makes this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, by speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very impressed by when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow not just a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial points for anyone willing to provide an education in self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental -- but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take charge in the issue and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
It's challenging the status of how women are seen, and I talked in our circles.
It's not good for us to tell with the flow of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of a <unk> athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge the people for what they are, not as you can see.
All of us can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the comments that we published in our social networks.
We can teach people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you question: When was the last time you <unk> a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to change our culture, so that our children will grow to be valuing their own individual, valuing individuality, diversity <unk>
We have to put people in really making the difference in a <unk>
Let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them that they go out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they see they are never going to be those who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for somebody in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
He <unk> his <unk>
Could it be simply the woman who is two seats in a distance. What would it mean for her if he had been released from that voice to be able to get it out in his interior, and I would give him a lot more <unk> <unk> more <unk> a smaller sister, smaller feet.
What would it mean for her if we were doing this and would allow her to communicate with his potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is <unk> to all.
But let's give our kids to the truth.
So what you do is that the way you see is just part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They would have the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's switch each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And working together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that small <unk> of a year of age today, they become insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November five of November 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk>
In fact, initially I was innocent, it was innocent, but being introduced by other charges <unk> in the company of others, started planning on attacks at about 12 icons in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans was taken by an FBI informant to get the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, was not allowed to avoid.
More later <unk> would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an effective engineer with a <unk> Mother <unk> teacher to elementary school did everything possible for me to give me happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My dad taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to know.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require much to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion -- in all human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who were so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that you need to use all possible media for everybody to live like them.
A few months before her arrest him, he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and he explained that in the last week of week, he and some friends had been going to record training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> shot <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me support the <unk> on the shoulder, and explained how to point at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that shot gave him the little orange light on the target and surprise of all, especially me, the whole goal broke out on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
From such a father, such child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those of those people later would be <unk> to put a van with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground tower of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone was a moment of pack and going to another city.
As long as I was the new face of class, it was often <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white man, but it will be the new one of the silent and silent class was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills, to say <unk> in growing low <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
And I was informed opera judging people, based on <unk> <unk> like his race or his religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put to test my way of thinking, was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program, I participated in the National Convention, <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a <unk> victim -- almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I found that one of the guys that we had done was Jewish age.
I took several days out to the light that detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and quite frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that my whole life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer work in Bush -- an amusement park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all the homosexuals were bad <unk>
I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in the show, and I could see that several of them were the tiniest and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people -- exactly the way I wish we wish to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had been taught me as a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is about being homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest about my <unk> and I was helping me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he turned my shape into a moment where I was desperately desperately <unk>
Instead, inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how my mother was changing, and she told me something that I keep in my heart forever, while she's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who had suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate inside of it.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put on a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I have done it because I hope somebody else is to lead to violence, I can hear my story and to understand that there is a better way, than even though I was dealing with this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, against those without meaning, as rejection of my father's actions.
With this simplicity I put up here as evidence that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that the children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Right now, there's a film that is projects in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> movie.
It's 3D and it's got sound that you hear and you see right now -- but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your <unk> of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you have experienced everything in straightforward.
This film is your <unk> the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each one of us is conscious.
We all have a personal movie that you, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know that I have a <unk>
I have no certainty that you're aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not conscious -- nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> movies.
Why are we not just robots that we have to do that we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
<unk> that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to have a science of consciousness.
Science in science, is objective by nature.
<unk> by nature, is subjective minds.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we had that vision.
The psychology was studying mathematical behavior, neuroscience is studying the mathematical brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> they said, <unk> is the moment for science to promote <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of science science in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something of this kind of fantastic job that Nancy <unk> was a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work in neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain how to explain how to explain how to certain areas of the brain and what they do with the <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There are actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real core mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why does this internal internal film exist?
Right now, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk> explanation.
The typical <unk> are all of the emerging behaviors how they operate <unk> how they work <unk> how are they <unk> and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how it looks like.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a phenomenon <unk> how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why all of behavior is accompanied by an authentic experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't still have a lot to say.
I am a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that was not working for inorganic reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a whole chain of amazing explanations -- we get used to this, physics explains chemical chemistry, explains biology, biology accounts for a piece of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to take that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our worldview, but we don't still know how.
With an anomaly as this one, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that are going to be involved in crazy before being able to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem about consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain of the brain, and you study all the things that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> conscious consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is fairly close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic stuff.
Instead, they think of them as fundamental and there is actually building the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental people will be saved.
In the 19th century, Maxwell discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, space, mass laws -- so I applied from Newton. And I applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- <unk> space, time, mass, then for logic -- you have a <unk>
The natural thing would be <unk> the way it was a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
That doesn't mean that all of a sudden is not the object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect awareness to the other core concepts -- space, the weather, physical processes.
Now, physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple that we could be able to <unk> them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we could get them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This approach is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, every system is conscious -- not only humans, the dogs, mice, including the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has a degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anguish when you think about "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little mad for you.
How did someone think something so crazy?
Some of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's naturally natural that can be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to be <unk> it's much less for people in different cultures, where human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that we have thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
There is always information processing, is <unk>
<unk> of <unk> complex, like in a human being, and complex awareness.
<unk> of simple, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, I took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a kind of mathematical integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And they're supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration information, just quite meaningful -- degree of consciousness quite important.
But when it comes to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In the <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
<unk> the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality that underlies the bottom.
How explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire <unk>
From <unk> vision to the equations you can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is that he puts fire at equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
So this vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and very ethical and ethical issues.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that it was not supposed to eat anything that had consciousness, then it should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think of thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has a processing of complicated information, integrated information, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, there are pretty serious ethical problems that are pretty serious ethical problems about the development of intelligent computers and smart computers and ethics ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the collective collective awareness of the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a local level, an integrated group in an integrated group like the audience in a TED Talk at this moment, we have a TED movie -- a internal film for this whole group of TED -- different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve at night in the morning.
But I think we finally will be going to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I fell to my friends, I was <unk> with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to get a community in the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a problem.
She actually didn't get anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a underwater profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as an achievement if we took the disability outside the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching him in a high school in <unk> and just after 20 minutes at the kind of <unk> studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What a <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on chairs of wheels, they talk about things <unk> in school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had expertise with disabled people as inspirational objects.
And we are not -- and it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there for inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage where I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to say, right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is a <unk> A A number of a capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something wrong and doesn't make you remarkable.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad deal.
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without the hands drawing with a pencil holding through the mouth.
You may have seen a kid running with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we gave a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disabled people in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been talking about strange <unk> to express that you believe that I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going on before my job had a public profile.
It was as if I got up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will match people with disability in benefit from people without disabilities.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not that bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
So let's make a few things.
But the things that we are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> which is deliberately deliberately <unk> by calling me the social model of the <unk> that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society where we live that because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those photos as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're just using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people are saying, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, I don't know.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
Tell them about other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> of <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  So you know, <unk> the ingenious trick of how to carry the phone battery into the battery on the chair.
Great.
We learn from force and toughness of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we are <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold to us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad thing, the reason that that's lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stairs, has never made it to become a <unk>
Never.     <unk> at a television screen will not make the scores for people <unk>
Nor do a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl who was sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered <unk> nothing for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> by getting up from bed and remembering our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine approach, and I want to live in a world where a boy at 11 grade in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a user of <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe is knowing about it.
Thank you.
What do we have to do is augmented reality and professional soccer with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think of reality, they think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but reality augmented is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know that, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step is what I'm wearing <unk> Google Glass.
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the countryside.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to figure it out.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is run by the game game to 160 blood <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that this is a man from 110 pounds of <unk> trying to <unk> it all its being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
I would take some videos to show you what it is to use Google <unk> under the hull, and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the <unk> <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of emerging technology is a submarine coming up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A little bit. We'll get a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective.
You may have realized that there are people -- the rest of the team.
We have a video of those, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue Blue Blue Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> can see from the angle of <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we took it to the next one."
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many you know about.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why we have this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man on a roller coaster for his life.
What is going to be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of Adrian crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before running and making a <unk> which is going to be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> by releasing the ball across the network?
What is their experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk>
Maybe it's <unk> the <unk> sales for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is augmented reality when <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to his field <unk> so that he would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to go.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers who were much faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player coming back to his group, and you see your next one player shown in front of you, on a plastic bombsight that you have installed in front of you, you don't have to worry about to forget a <unk>
<unk> the strategy.
They just go out into the field and <unk>
And the coaches do it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose games, they hate <unk>
If you lose parties <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But reality augmented is not just a <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that is down.
You also get information from the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
You'll have information <unk>
This is <unk> by good teams of bad equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being just for everybody."
It will be also <unk> Who would have thought?
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that you are the field <unk>
We put the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open <unk> All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- <unk> that a defense behind you is going to kill you, typically, you don't get it, but the <unk> system will <unk>
It <unk> the protection.
Another <unk> you tell you that there's an open receptor.
You get the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land yet, the receptor sees in its bombsight -- an area of grass <unk> and it can modify the career.
They <unk> capture the <unk> runs and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have been followed from each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use only as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth of <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions in the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth to a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it is being <unk>
How much is it worth of a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as usual, from us.
Thank you.
I recently grew up after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago I spent the country -- the southern tip of County <unk> which includes the <unk> <unk> bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful <unk> <unk> the Pacific Ocean -- and its inspiring architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> bridge bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> an expert chief forced to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much proof of <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and no <unk>
But from its openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped in their death from that bridge.
Some of them think that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, as the each one from it, frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go down under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free fall of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact <unk> the bone, some of which would provide vital organs.
Most of you die in impact.
Those who don't normally get into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that <unk> this method of suicide realizes to be aware of the <unk> death that was <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people have to get before they took life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we got that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
Let's take it to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who will get suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at the 22 <unk> last year by receiving a call of a possible subject subject sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, he watched Jason talking to a British <unk> bridge officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and I had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up to two times before from New Jersey to try to kill them from this bridge.
After about a time talking to <unk> I asked ourselves, if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology -- <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, "We will never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out with <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped some <unk> leaned over the right, and it left.
This kind and smart guy in New Jersey had just gotten away from life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had just order.
<unk> copyright damage, affect a lot of people.
I give you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved to be <unk>
What about <unk>
What about that?
In my experience, not just to speak, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like you feel, because you probably don't hear it.
Just being there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> don't be afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it, can save the life and be the inflection for them.
Other signs at <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be able to <unk> -- they will believe that there is nothing you can do with the <unk> social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read to you your letter.
She lost his son at the age of January and this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he is with her permission and blessing that <unk>
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking it should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still fairly <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father at the 19th of January.
It never got there.
I called the police police police and the <unk> as it disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the <unk> car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump out of the bridge to the <unk> of the late day before.
Thank you so much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been wrong without having a real heart disease.
It should not be so easy to end it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a possible subject of a possible subject on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
<unk> my travels on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and a half of the next one, I heard like Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided to do that day come back on that lane come back to another chance.
And when Kevin turns out when Kevin turns out it <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did that <unk> and <unk> life and <unk> life.
And you know what he told me?
He said, "Can I <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mom, and I have that letter with me, and I would like you to <unk>
"Dear Lord <unk> No <unk> events in March 11, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I was only six months old, completely unconscious from all of those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God by yourself.
I really debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> When I visited General General in San Francisco at night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I know what I did have to do.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather committed <unk>
That act, despite finishing his own pain, theft the opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and <unk> around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too long.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked to him about about an hour.
For that time, I got my hand at three times.
At the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those ones that have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the second one that left side the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also to people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that all and every one of us should be able to do it to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There are help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question ask you, how do you become on that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I finally had a dream that had had a little bit of a child.
My outside finally fits my truth in my inner reality.
And it's complicated reasons, where I'm going to address this picture later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I found that <unk> I'm getting started.
We all have our families, our religion, our religion, our <unk> our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or for the belief that we all around us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years -- many of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, my agent, I ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> as I was born because of the appearance of my genital <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always had this t-shirt on his head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to get it?
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that in fact, it's a more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never told myself to share my story, not because I thought it will be a bad thing, but how the world is about those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have Mom and my family who would accept me like I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the principal of a <unk> beauty <unk>
That night she said, "Why haven't you ever involved in the contest of <unk>
He told me that if she was <unk> from the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won in the bathroom, I won in <unk> and he was third <unk> in over 40 years.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was from queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they were <unk> from the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom who had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told that he passed my request from the green card that I could go to the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I was called and said, "You know that if you ask the U.S., you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was in Thailand in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities to do the most sophisticated surgeries to do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In the U.S., then it was necessary to be done before changing the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and the gender <unk>
That was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears got <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> who was living in their truth, but <unk> put in end to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 of November we do a global vigil for <unk> <unk>
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who are <unk> and stood up at injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just me.
I want to do the best to help the others to live their truth without shame, and not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer <unk> 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
They'll you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> <unk> All of my <unk>
My support network, my parents especially, to my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and they told me her parents couldn't take me on the phone, called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's not just gender identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table that sometimes we didn't do that <unk> and there should be a space that would allow people to do -- and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice.
In many successful societies, and tribal societies are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by education defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts were lost, their efforts in 2011, with the <unk> National Republic of peace, became very famous -- a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the history of inequality of inequality and the exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies just from the very beginning, when you were born, a girl, his birth of birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome or his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes from, gives her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother would become a lot of <unk> a lot.
When he gives birth to the first child, the first child, the first girl gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he was born, his third daughter, feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only the mother <unk> but the daughter <unk> when it grows, it undergoes too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and the school would have got their brothers.
Until 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with his friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it comes in the age of 13 years, you have to leave her home without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the name of his father and his brothers and her brothers and her brothers and if they were <unk> the code of that <unk> they could even kill.
And it's interesting that this kind of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of their sisters in the name of the honor.
And there is a rule more than <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl should be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that accepts people's decisions and mother and mother decisions even if they don't want.
If you put it up with a man who doesn't like or if you did it with an old man, you have to <unk> because you don't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, he has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then it gives birth to more and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to his daughter and the very lesson of honor to their children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
And I said, brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was thinking about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was interested, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half years.
You might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I have to do it."
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in tribal societies, is a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
<unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of Saudi Canada, and I was on the relative part of family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I sat it down with me when my friends came to me.
He encouraged me to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to engage with their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all of these good values in my school to girls and girls all alike.
I used education for <unk>
I went to my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget about the lesson called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was a lethal rights for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
He was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of involvement in all of political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls were banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, I got up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog on the BBC, and offered her same for the New York Times documentaries and he spoke on every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the nine, October 2012, was hit in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would tell him to my wife and <unk> <unk> so I spent my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't stop you."
Let's get the right cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words are going to have a lot of fun words for me, and I didn't get to ask again.
When I was born, I was in the hospital and had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that would spread through the face of my wife.
But my daughter has never been <unk>
I used to say, "I'm fine with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to give you well. Please don't get sick.
It was a solace for us, and it was <unk>
And we put together brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist at the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any girl 16 years old.
<unk> when they didn't end their homework.
They fight her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are there special about my mentoring that has made so bold and so brave and <unk> and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
It didn't cut off your wings, that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the group of Google, where I have had a <unk> to my <unk> the Google de visualizing and all the work that I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or out of my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you hit a brain operation.
You're still like smart or not?
Is it not like this, you'll be intelligent again.
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what quantity to take, more than a dozen different chemicals every day, because if they didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations of things and mix of chemicals, and trying to support them to continue alive.
More than once I have saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the dose of <unk> because there's no clear map that tells you in <unk>
I started testing different <unk> and I was amazed to see how little changes in the dose would dramatically change my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
So a particularly particularly dramatic case for a few months, I took dose and chemists for a man in the 1900s, and I was surprised by seeing how my thinking would change.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- -- of course, many times in the past I've met several kinds of guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to do -- I have to have a better appreciation for men.
What I was trying to do is I adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my creative <unk>
I think almost always in images, and that became my point of key reference, how do you get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you get rid of new ideas and recreating situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in similar ways.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are the people who are taking this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the mind works. For me it's simple: for most of us, the mental imagery is fundamental to <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I get to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great <unk> mentally <unk> very sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take good quick these mental imagery of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a director of film were able to use its imagination only to steer the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities for this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were made by two groups who were done in neuroscience.
Both of them used <unk> <unk> image to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The backbone of the <unk> shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual as you were looking at this same image.
The column on the right was created by <unk> the contents of the left column on the left of the left -- you see that the difference is almost higher.
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the World Jack lab, in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual fields that they did.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a huge pool of brain reactions to the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new animals, new animals, and as long as they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer, using only brain information from the scan of the scanning -- to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're pretty close to do that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you can imagine that same picture, you create the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the world's largest brain scanning systems available today, and their resolution is increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a few times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do that?
There's a lot of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and put it on.
I don't give that one.
Many are proposing new projection techniques by images, including me, <unk> with the recent result of the <unk> first to ask the next one, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is to have bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offers little improvements in resolution -- doesn't get a huge amount of money.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements.
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the Li-Fi and endangered radio frequency frequency in MRI.
Instead, instead of a magnetic magnetic field in the same way, it will bring the magnetic patterns to the frequencies of <unk> radio patterns.
So by combining magnetic patterns in the patterns of processing radio processing -- we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers of increasing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the fluid of blood <unk> but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity. This is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas in direct form to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more options that will open up this door.
But anyway, choose a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Your closet is probably telling you a person for the first time you love her or tell somebody who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or say to someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have to do in life.
And everything is a hard conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and having come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side and worked in the South Side of the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> I didn't get my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I'm going to be <unk> that by the <unk> of my little <unk> and for having my head -- I was doing a little bit, I would ask me -- usually a child, like, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there'd be uncomfortable silence on the table.
I got my jaw a little bit further, would take me my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it came again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared -- and I was about to come up with the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues,"
And so I took my breath, and I went down and I went down and my back of a little pink dress with a pink dress staring at me, which is not a challenge for <unk> <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I took it down a little bit, again, I got <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like this guy, and I saw the children's clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a dress dress and sometimes like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Well, I'm more of the kind of girl in a ninja pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it.
What about the <unk> that we <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some lifetimes in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what the walls.
You just know how a feeling feels like living in a closet.
This is how my closet is not different from you or cancer or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons for me to go out of my mind was harder than coming out of it, but this is the thing: it's not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell you that to explain to somebody who has declared online bank is harder to say it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than to say to your age of five years that you're going to be <unk>
There is no more difficult, it's only about it.
We need to stop making it hard for us to make it hard to make other people feel better or worse in relation to our ideas, and we should just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or the less security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse of horse -- a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the lesbian lesbian <unk> ready to fight any four years to go into the coffee.
I was frozen for fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark dark mind -- my gay rage and moving only one muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers that I have spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was going around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you will kill.
One of my most memorable journey was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and when I was going to do my <unk> of <unk> in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents were in my parents, people who were known to me.
And after talking a moment, one of the women who were <unk> <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite <unk> show.
Our favorite and Grace program.
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting to show you desperately their support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt, <unk>
And I had a chance at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you are.
So this is how hard conversations keep without being my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have been <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I still like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it implies is coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl was not <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be a direct <unk> You just shake your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, they <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate its truth.
They have never been bothered by that.
And some of you may go wounded safe, <unk> by what they've done, but they never feel sorry for what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you may feel <unk> but that is something in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours did.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find a little bit of a dark closet for a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen -- an example productive has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of <unk> the computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from an alien race that you don't know about any biology of Earth or neuroscience of Earth's Earth nor from the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have lives incredibly long and so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if they are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it has no concept about intelligence on Earth, you'd be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through a number of disciplines, that I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will promote the diversity of future future.
Finally, in the development of robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the robots of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to make complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them to have a number of years ago, there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only an equation for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the most close equivalent of an E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is a strength, F, that it acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of potential accessible, yes, to an impending future, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping the options open.
And so having to realize this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
It was the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, I'll show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have a tendency to conditions more favorable for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what happens if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence has a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system where you can meet inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could happen multiple animal tests -- playing games of human games, play games, and even make money <unk> actions, it all without the fact that you have to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> <unk> here we see <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to be able to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is going to have applications for humanoid robotics and technology technology.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling away from the opposite of a string at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation have interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a <unk> game against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections on a social network where the friends are constantly challenged and keeps the net very connected net.
This same capability of network network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand the world level from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, they are widely applicable in defense issues, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated serial series of negotiation and successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have vast applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of <unk> human behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derived from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here is a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term <unk> the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we were smart machines, there would be an unhealthy rebellion in it.
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not the machines first become smart, and then they will try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all future is a more fundamental principle than intelligence that is general can actually emerge directly from taking control, rather than the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
I'm often asking me, how do you look for targets we learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to that statement to go to the descendants to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, this is this: intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the fabric of the stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
In the last few years, we've extended a tremendous amount of knowledge of how it connects to Earth in the context of the universe.
The NASA NASA mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points to Earth is only one between the billions of planets from our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint light intensity when planets go ahead of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that we go.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At its time, this is clues about if these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this distribution of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us for millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist and no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets similar to the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet, and the planets that we know -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is little and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world, shown this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> tracks its surface in search of clues about the origins of life as well as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not just short space flight but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and highest places on Earth the air is cool and filled with oxygen filled with our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets will get a big and sad amount of implication, and the belief in some that Mars will expect there to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly livable the Earth.
For a lot that I like exploration of it, I'm in profound disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is how to imagine that the Titanic captain will tell us that the <unk> really will be more late in <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration and Earth preservation are not <unk>
No, they are actually expensive the same <unk> the goal to understand and preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> <unk>
You just find it closer home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile areas and the hostile areas of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
So let me leave you with an experiment with an experiment.
A lot of years ago, Mother Enrico Fermi said, "I have to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to continue to live among the stars, they lose the notion of how important is to protect the origin of the planets that we bring up this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and they were all well closed.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and <unk> from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than a <unk> at the middle night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, I would be well over.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which increases heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could be done, systems that could put in their place, that <unk> things bad things.
Or at least, if bad things happen, that <unk> the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe of.
So I started to think about that, but even one month later, my thoughts don't exist.
I was having dinner with my colleague -- Danny <unk> won the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him about breaking the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I'd been practicing something called hindsight hindsight
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, then try to figure out what can do to prevent things in to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some of the things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, they <unk> a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a place of the location of the important things -- where the things are right, where the fish are places where the trees are <unk> where tribes live in female and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find your nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still could find your nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that are moving too much.
This is the reason for losing your car <unk> reading and <unk>
So at home home, a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
So for your passport, a <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you look at a place and they're <unk> it will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of your credit cards -- license to drive, passport, it would go for yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases your cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation that when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to be loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talking about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for every decision making medical decisions, and in fact for making financial decisions and social choices, any kind of decision you need to take from that would benefit an rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the laboratory and the cholesterol is a little <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of diseases -- heart attack, heart injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol isn't the best, then the physician says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most active drugs in the world today, and you may be even likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask for that most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before they help one person.
And you have to think about what kind of statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of a doctor, and if it's somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk> mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before it helps one person?
300.
This according to the research of researchers that cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently independently by <unk>
I was exploring the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 feet down my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more <unk> and it is, <unk> from the <unk> effects. Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of patients.
And those include things that include making muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still to take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you look at it over time, so you don't have to manufacture the chain of thinking about the act.
300 people are taking the drug, right? A person has taken up five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out of the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I just say that you have to have this conversation with your physician.
<unk> ethics is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this necessary number to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the older men in the age of 50, <unk> prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a more short life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that point is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it's not very quickly. They might be the lunch in the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to deal with that to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to avoid the bad things happening in the first place.
I went on the night in Montreal in Montreal when I returned from my journey, my contractor settled on my journey, and I settled on a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards I haven't ordered -- and lots of messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more smoothly.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- I will never be a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs language came over the decade in 1800, and over the time, it mixed with local signs, and this is the language that we now know as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, is like me living in a foreign country, following their rules, providing behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of chips from <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, you're not <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting with <unk> the sound that's about to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to do the self with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic board there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend -- and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered in my art territory now.
Will it be more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel <unk> or you can experience it visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound ownership and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had been taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, the power -- the <unk> <unk>
In the background of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a kind of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could well take it to me and my artistic work, or I could tell you.
I chose that I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around verbal language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just like and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in school, work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary time form as well as taking a loan on a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't be able to capture and completely express on the paper.
And the same can be said in a concept in <unk>
The two are very highly <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals as much of the sounds as much of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you get better understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into a lot of different <unk>
If a <unk> a different <unk> for every finger while the facial expression, the facial expression, the speed, the speed, the <unk> the speed, the shape of your hand and so while the piano hits the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it's just <unk> it just once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers <unk> to express a clear concept or an idea of <unk>
If only one key would change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters, you can tell you different ideas.
So for example, the signal is <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I was hooked.
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the <unk> <unk>
If I had to have to create a sign and put it over and over again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign -- the sun comes out and put it up.
This is all day."
If you go through it, and you take the visually speed, it looks like a music piece.
All of the day.
I feel like the same can be said to <unk> tonight."
All tonight."
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  Let's ask the tonight."
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time we express time in <unk> and how distance to body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the final thing that is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, let's turn it over again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> rate of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk>
Watch <unk> right hand -- <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> E, <unk> I'm going to show you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
Everyone with my hands.
Now we're going to do this as much in my head as your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages all around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest -- it actually transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy just like music.
However, today, we live in a very tight world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sounds, it doesn't automatically have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines the social value and allow <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> not that you have to hear music to learn from.
The <unk> is a rich trove of treasure.
I'd like to get to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me, "You can do everything, but then you have to get it up.
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination was led to all these wonderful places, and that is where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- because the adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also also understand, and they are not very good to clean up the others.
The country country, now I'm an adult and teach invention and invention of <unk> Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk on the beach with lots of garbage.
So as a good citizens, <unk> the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use these huge boats there.
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our <unk> classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We begin to build this <unk> work for the kids that are very <unk> so they can also participate.
And I will tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools are cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to the plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do that.
I leave it to my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas out of every child and try to <unk> in something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, it just provides information.
So we took a robot, and we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot with robots.
And then we quickly created what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in creating prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we transform light and web cameras, and we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and by the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see plastic bits floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measuring the size of each particle, to get a rough estimate of how much plastic is in the water.
<unk> this step-by-step invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else gets it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I was looking at my problem, and my students in Hong Kong are very good kids.
You see the news news, they get the Internet, and they get together with this image: itself.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> the water where they live? the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown, clay and oil are also brown color, and when all of you <unk> it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other other children.
I was looking at a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, perhaps to tackle a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half the French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear station close to water.
And today, according to a average 300 metric tons still is leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution from <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that the most radiation part of radiation disappeared from the coast of <unk> and most people, it has safe and it's blue.
Well, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned to <unk> every year from the accident and performed independently with other scientists, the land, the river, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course we don't have the <unk> the parents don't know it.
But every night we would go to the center of <unk> here -- you see the use of different masks ...
It might seem like they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this, we were able to notice that the radioactive dust goes off from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk> <unk>
But based on this organized a civil expedition -- the nearest to the nuclear central to date.
We get closer to a mile of nuclear, and with the <unk> help in the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a sediment as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve problems.
I wonder if we should get the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became so much small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we become the biggest space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the heart Hong Kong center, and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal chemistry, a little bit of optical biology, you can basically build almost everything.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where kids can become reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in mobility of the age of advanced age transforming their standard wheels on new vehicles in <unk>
The plastic and oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So by scientists, scientists, <unk> we need to prepare for the next generation to worry about the environment and the people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of one thread of a silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing we thought about it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that will struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of <unk>
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that it would take for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least in the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained trained to think about their objects as <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material <unk> in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> with small <unk>
You act mostly as a filter, the other primarily as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
This is a system that gradually moves its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here is a split screen, which represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect at work currently in the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the body between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right right -- and a synthetic hemisphere shows you on two screens after me.
My work, at the most simple, tries to bring these two visions in the world, moving from assembly and approaching growth.
I'm probably asking you right now?
Why did it not be possible that 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where we were <unk> four disciplines that provides access to access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And on the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet your minds and my students' hands.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools across scales, on big scale, like this robotic arm with a <unk> base, in diameter with a <unk> base, that some day will not be very distant to print <unk> buildings, and graphics on the nanoscale <unk> that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where each opening is size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion <unk> with <unk> -- it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator -- we print this layer and <unk> this layer and 3D <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and rigid materials on the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a brain scanner, <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical analytical and <unk> instruments it allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the time, a comfortable chair and also absorb sound.
The Carter teacher, my collaborator came back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of surface surface <unk> becomes <unk>
We put this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like nature, changes its functionality not by addition to other material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> the material property.
But it's the nature of it.
There's no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what really matters.
Like she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a tree -- <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference in the trunk, and it branches sheets and <unk>
The whole tree was <unk>
Instead, the land made up <unk> trees with twigs, crust, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if the objects were made of a <unk>
Would you have a better state of <unk>
So we look for the <unk> material -- the kind of material in the tree and <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second largest <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million metric tons of produce every year by organisms as shrimp, crabs, crabs, and <unk>
We think that if we could tune in to the <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of seed <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the soft and transparent.
To print the <unk> structures that was built up a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could actually vary the properties of material on the march and create these structures made of a single decade, a long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are <unk> it leaves it to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we continue to design <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of printing were used to contain <unk> <unk> which first showed up on the planet does three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria engineered to capture carbon rapidly in the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems to frequency -- and if it broadens even more, on windows.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little synthetic biology -- we've transformed a structure of foam shrimp into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> they put them in the sea, and <unk> life and placed on the floor, will help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for the <unk>
To do that, we have to master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> board, we made our own new forms of living -- new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> and <unk> of biological form.
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, they were <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the ponds of fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacterium that lives in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never danced.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
To hold these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the tract tract -- that will help you to build these bacteria and to make it a function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material as the functionality <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> channels more transparent.
This digestive digestive system, when you stretch from one end to another, it takes 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our very thin.
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> channels -- brilliant channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are growing creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design is going to take the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that gain matter <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin <unk> the tissue harmed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
It's always to go back to nature.
So right now, you know that a 3D printer <unk> material <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they <unk>
<unk> is not about this level of <unk>
It's done by combining not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, we put those fibers between each other.
And this is all over scales.
The silk worm first goes on in the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, glue a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk worm of silk.
However, when we put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different environments, different <unk> and we've discovered that shape the shape -- the <unk> structure <unk> directly by the environment.
It's often <unk> silk worms to death inside their <unk> and their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
What we saw is designing these templates -- we can shape the raw silk without boiling <unk>
They <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we had this process to architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put into our site.
We knew that silk worms went into the dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar path to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat -- distributing silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> they were <unk> they put <unk> and <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said the tension is great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk on silk -- <unk> <unk> give this whole pavilion its integrity.
And in little more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the road route of silk.
The <unk> after the <unk> produced 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other empty one.
If the last edge of design is to bring the products to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must unite these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, that leads us from a design inspired by nature in the nature of a inspired nature of us, which demands us, for the first time, we make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked you to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were when they asked them for the first time.
They can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had a <unk>
In school I liked the English and <unk> and art and collected websites -- but also playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general I like to try and persist anyway, it would have spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I was focusing on something else, something completely different, and I would get away in it, and I will get <unk> and I feel <unk> I have found it -- and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk> at all.
I was worried to be afraid of engagement, or whether I am sprinkled or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I'd like to have asked me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the hell of the culture.
We ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have five years old.
And the truth is that nobody matters what they were going to do.
It's considered a naive question to cause cute answers in children like, to be <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question gets us over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, ask them to be asked to choose in university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before you take the dream.
Why?
If well this question inspire kids to dream with what they might be, not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it's doing right at the contrary, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though well-intentioned -- maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> professor and creative terrorists.
But most of the children don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they are going to have to choose.
But it is more than that.
The very notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real vocation, the idea that each of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and to dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up and many different things that want to do?
There's no place for somebody in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel that there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> to say.
It could be able to do if you divide it into three multiple <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we have to do the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the course of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was fine in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> It's about us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as a limitation or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned by talking with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in the way that way.
Here are three superpowers here.
One: synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new in the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, planning and design.
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry.
To <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea of the unique idea by their <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And <unk> with all its background, can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second embarrassing superpower, is learning quickly.
When we put them together, we are <unk>
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to Bhutan for having been laughing so many times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test new things and come out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we are <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a complete <unk> of complete time and <unk>
As a little piano girl, an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest familiar <unk>
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they were starting their practices, and this ability helps to write compelling times for the editors.
<unk> is rarely a waste of time to do what you want, even if at the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform anything you need in a given situation in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes a director of videos, others, a web designer, sometimes a teacher Kickstarter, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take care of different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to do it to meet the market needs -- the ones that actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas -- quick learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three abilities that you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have right now, and we need a lot of creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
They came from the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put in ideas, and <unk> provides a span of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and careers that are connected with the way we're connected.
And unfortunately, <unk> in a large part of them are given to them as just as their <unk>
And once you say this, if there's one thing you can take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then <unk> for all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
We do the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman called <unk> they brought it to a <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> it till she passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you had been lived today, we couldn't give her more help than the one who was <unk> gave her a year ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk>
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have been antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from infections, many treatments for cancer <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's also made progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live to the 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there's the likelihood that your years is going through Alzheimer's disease or helping care of a friend or loved with Alzheimer's.
In the U.S., health care costs 200 dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care spends in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs to increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be <unk> cure or even slow their development.
We understand less Alzheimer's than of other diseases because we've invested less time and money on the research of it.
The U.S. government spends 10 times a year in cancer research than Alzheimer's year despite the fact that we have more costs more and more that is a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, we all -- we all even, scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only to look at a picture of a healthy aged healthy brain compared to the DNA of a healthy patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces the life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds into an origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these little dots -- they end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some of these points are left out of the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University, trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are lots of steps, and the identification of which step is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
You get a cable to do anything.
<unk> others can make the <unk>
You need to find the right step that we put it, and then create a drug that does it.
It even recently, in its most short part of the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> physical chemicals, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've achieved a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's take a few videos from what happened by testing these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms -- on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick each other into them, like in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to learn where Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and if we fix it, we can <unk>
In the case of other conditions, patients and their families have captured more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to progress on HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most of a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs at risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Times <unk> in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience by testing it -- I was one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to be 36 more and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking about for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or <unk> what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time you go to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> these are getting more and more personal ones.
Number one: <unk> really <unk> me, Tell your partner what you like to be like, or her, I know so honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say somebody you've ever known.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, one really really struck me attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the occasion of this study, with somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the neocortical column, so I send a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already August, so I guess some of you probably are asking, keep together in <unk>
And the reason I think it's <unk> this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had encouraged to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views as much, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would reach probably a few thousands of view.
And that hit a good charge of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was posted on a Friday night, and on Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And on Sunday, I had been called the "Today Show me and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper received over eight million <unk> and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence he is writing with each other <unk> experience, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always did first the same question: They still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
Several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and <unk> journalists like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
I even gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to sit comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for St. <unk> which included the experiences of the readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that they both make a public emergence together.
We put television interviews, and I was <unk> the shots of the photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons that I think of a <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study would work, they wanted to know if the study was really able to figure out if it was able to make love love, not just an adventure, but love love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship had just a few months and I felt, especially people said the wrong question.
How do you know if we were together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 <unk> questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, he was looking for <unk> <unk> between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic isn't it?
But the study worked.
The participants felt closer after doing that, several later studies, also used protocol and <unk> <unk> as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used among members of the police and community -- and they've used it among people of political ideologies <unk>
The original version of the story, which I <unk> last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> tried the study, and it didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, you want to say that you love the person with the person who <unk> it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> who were able to get better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really hard separation in it.
He had had that relationship since I had 20, what almost my entire adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how it could or if I could live without it.
So I took it to science.
I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that to be a certain form of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I only did this for the book I wrote but in retrospect, seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was built with knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel that bad and I used to feel like that.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what we <unk>
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can tell you that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than anything to do with me to demand me.
What I'm looking for love is a guarantee -- not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people would ask when they wanted to know if we were all together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the risk <unk> and this is a very scary story because in love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
So the story of the story that is, I'm still following together?
And your content with a response of Yes or No.
So more than a question, you know, let's ask more difficult questions, questions like, How do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things get involved, and how do you know when to cut and cut into it.
How do you live in uncertainty that inevitably comes to a relationship? Or even more, how you live in doubt in your partner?
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more thoughtful conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love with not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love with <unk> because we took the choice to be.
And <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that I was supposed to do.
I didn't think how many times would we have both to make that decision, and how much should I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and said, 36 questions, I have chosen to love someone so generous, kind and fun and having expressed that choice in the largest diary newspaper.
But what I've done instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really understand.
And what I'm going to do, and maybe going through my life is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending in the title of my article -- which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't write on.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he would also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian <unk> and in a certain way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York City a long time ago --  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and you take a dollar ticket a dollar, a feather and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of these strange <unk> or some aliens aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a time given was in <unk> <unk> I like to go from <unk> and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took it all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> style, I Martin, I covered it in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it was attached to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking, I could get it.
Instead, the opposite happened, somehow it seemed to be size, somehow it seemed to be like size, as if it was that I would have the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements -- strange ones that I was going to find out the street, all that I could find, because I was looking for things that was all about my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can I draw in space.
I can flow out of drawing as well as about a <unk> <unk>
And I pulled out objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very much fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibits and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human way, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings in layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing on a window, then on another window and another window window, and I had all these windows together together that make a three-dimensional composition work.
And this really work, and I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work filled with something very big, which I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
<unk> long.
It's double <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
So here is where the creatures with heads of animals are headed by <unk> ready to suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god <unk> tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform.
But anyway, it's also kind of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil on a hand while from the other hand coming out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a mythological thing that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a tail of 5.5 feet long, a snake tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn to fire on a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why that happened.
Things that go out you know.
Her tail ends up in a <unk> of <unk> made of terrorist cards of 1986.
You've got them <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards for terrorists.
Very <unk> to your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a two-year project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a file of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or innovate.
But each one acts as a sort of archive in the form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they get together.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds with a dead human inside it.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, you can get the input off.
I'm going to play it for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall out of the chest, and that you can cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers that you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and go into the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little bit of the forest scene inside <unk> cavity <unk>
Can you imagine?
But anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We are in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box, there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician a musician a musician -- a musician, a radio, a <unk> a <unk> a publishing arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
We cut the box and all the people inside hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that he is living on.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, of the countries of religion, does not work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start trading those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill you have effect against pain, first happens by your stomach, the guts and other organs.
Take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug has made it effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take drugs that are actually <unk> to reduce the amount of virus in the blood, and increase the account of skeletal cells.
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in their negative, because in the time they take it to the blood stream, they get worse and worse even for the time that they take to get to fate, which is where most importantly, in the storage of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes. the nervous system -- the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the bloodstream of the patients that are being sold to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells <unk>
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life running through oral lives.
And one day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> making the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the wounds and surgery and diabetes in diabetes, you can be used for anything <unk> including the drug transport of medicines.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses in order to open or drill into extremely small holes, which open up and shut almost the cells that are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask, "What is that <unk>
We sent a very powerful <unk> laser membrane on the cell membrane infected with HIV as these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug at a matter of <unk>
Before you even realize it, the hole is really <unk> immediately.
We're now testing this technology in vitro or <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> in the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is moving to the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases directly in the site of infection, as the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this is not a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to total eradication of HIV from the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of the whole researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand these agents of violence in violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent involvement into violent <unk>
I do the field work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> <unk>
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> arrangements of peace arrangements that we found in 1975, and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they make it, but no one is looking at what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and the policies are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his <unk> <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian known for his suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just fire.
It's multitasking language.
They had a complex machine of <unk> charging stations, television channels websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising. It is not <unk> but by <unk> business companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their funds, to get better and build their brand.
<unk> groups do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run their schools, run professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that is not safe and protection.
The Taliban in an Afghanistan of Afghanistan had been torn by war or even the beginning of the <unk> of <unk> can also be examined the efforts of these groups for delivering security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher higher price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and they allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, civic victory in 2006 <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex setting, even in the West, when we look at groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term view.
These groups are hybrid people.
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups, engage in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated the sophisticated ones are these organizations, less can be able to behave as something contrary to a state.
How would a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory run all the <unk> they collect the garbage, they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines <unk>
We live in a world of states, from nations without state, and the weaker the states, the states, as in the Middle East today, more <unk> and fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in the military tools.
<unk> that government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we better understand groups -- we will better understand what incentives to offer the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, not yet military power can win some fights, but we don't bring peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need for long-term investments to fill out that safe <unk> to fill out that government of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a feminist and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the tag of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a geneticist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I love it as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a book and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke was meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and they hated sex.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> which might be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty.
I love as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who ask too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
With the time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> free of bullying or violence.
We have right to use it in a right to use it and accessible the contraceptives and the services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social, skills and much more.
We have to have to see these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music -- all volume.
Though the letter appeared to <unk> women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin yang of <unk> is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
We said, poetry, right?
I am completely overwhelmed by my musical thinking.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the collection of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and maintaining <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's his election, and I'm not the one who is <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her kids, I don't have that choice as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same election, the problem is that our society is rooted in a way that makes women economically vulnerable when they behave.
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism who has ignored or diverted historically the needs of color women, the gay and gay workers and <unk> favor of white, <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism -- I'm a really bad feminist guy.
It also happens as this: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we will be able to play perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I was already <unk> from that <unk> before you try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that tag means is not being able to be able to fulfill the <unk>
Let's take for example, or as I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> three feet tall.
It was a show of <unk> to see this star of poo embrace the feminism and to do to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started endless arguments if it was or not just a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, rather than just believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection by <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much to be a lot.
We go much beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad challenge is, or rather, one more <unk> is the point of departure.
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> <unk> going into action and being a little bit more <unk>
If I hear <unk> music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> <unk>
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they make change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are justify that it makes it harder for women to achieve equality, gender equality we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think in my <unk> three and four years.
These are two <unk> <unk> and <unk> and also very brave. I want you to grow up in a world.
They are told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option is going to look like something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program deals with sexual violence against women as sports, <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio wave when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies are not treating women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports in professional sports where athletes treat their partners as <unk>
In any case, men, especially who white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his journal magazine, they can say, "No, I'm not going to post in her project, and I would work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women as much to participate in order to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of those of us who are <unk> but they were going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects, but we can also be able to be even more like the way we are trying to overcome the barriers to decision making.
Because we're not a <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will get to the top, to people in power engineers and film producers and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make large decisions, more courageous, to create lasting and significant change.
We can also tell with bravery for our feminism, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I tell you, above all, because the <unk> my voice was stolen and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I would get my voice, and after all I didn't get to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I would get involved in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like me, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little bit brave -- another woman could go down, and see me and realize that none of us is the world about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I argue the <unk> reality. I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, -- I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope we all can be a little bit courageous, when more you need such a courage.
Just after Christmas last year, I was bringing kids in California, they had gone up to be visited by <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things in this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with a immune immune system, is one of the most easily diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak that had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that sparked the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> disqualified and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most of us scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines are going to put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the blood estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> that I'd heard about her creating their own professional life without seeing one case.
In decades, the prevalence estimates went stable just three or four children per 10,000 children.
But then, in the 1990s the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> by funding as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could catch another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic and a better detection of <unk> to explain these disparate numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who is looking for the face of his two years, the visual contact of it.
If the criteria of diagnosis, they had to figure out why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the visual power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten about the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital at <unk> Hopkins Hospital -- he published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> and a private worlds, they were asking people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by shaking their hands on their faces, but they were prey to panic as when they didn't put their favorite toy in his usual place without knowing them.
Over the basis of the patients were treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the years of 1950, as the main authority of the world on the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as they pick up the <unk> of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving kids <unk> but now we know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
One time he realized that he had become nine of each 10 children sent for other doctors to his office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of childhood mortality caused by cold parents and <unk>
And these kids, he said, they've stayed very carefully on a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills they are breeding in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in his clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he was properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were just <unk> what they heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Well, amazingly, it wasn't to the <unk> that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> A cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mothers <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband were warm and warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl like black-eyed Susie! No special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service of Health that we needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and his colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
<unk> a study of autism in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find other autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse.
Some kids couldn't talk at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit in <unk> and <unk> as he said, and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did nobody realize about these children before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he got <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> throw in his own work.
There was not even one translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was talking German, and he translated it to her.
The document is offered an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas to teach children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music classes with music, and the children followed their games on late afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of autism, Asperger's as described as a <unk> disability of life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the methods of education that were particularly suited for them.
And bread saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of disabled and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuous <unk> of <unk> in pop culture like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, one of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong that autism was <unk> as well as parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, worked silently with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and inclusive.
These changes did not stay broken down.
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before he came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, and parents all over the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first easy clinics to use to diagnose autism.
It no longer had to have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes on the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect storm a perfect storm of the autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact expected to be like this -- making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the rise of the rise in the <unk> and a simple, <unk> story as bad as the <unk> theory of autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one in 68 children in America are on the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the largest largest groups in the world.
Over the last few years, people have been linked to the Internet to reject the idea that they're the puzzles for solving the new breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way of understanding <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> the human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit to details.
In fact, autistic people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most popular aspects of autism -- they find themselves in the understanding of teachers, employers with ability, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we went through to an uncertain future, we need all forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
